What a nervous night to be walking home from the movies, Scooby-Doo. And all because you had to stay and see Star: Dog Ranger of the North Woods twice. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! - What's that? - It's coming from the bushes. Go see what it is, Scooby. - Don't worry, I'm right behind you. - Thanks a lot. Oh, well. Scooby, come back! Wait! Where he go? Where he go? - Like, next time, signal. - Sorry. Hey, what's that? Looks like a deserted-type pickup truck. Anyone home? You're right, Shaggy. This sure is strange. Yeah. What's an empty, old suit of armor doing in the driver's seat of this pickup? Maybe he went out for the knight. Get it? - Very funny. - Gosh I wonder who this creepy hunk of tin belongs to. Well, the name on the crate says, "Jameson Hyde White Professor of Archeology. London, England. " - Hyde White? - I've heard of hide-and-seek before but I've never heard of Hyde White. That's an English name, you comedians. Hey, what's this? It's a delivery label that says: "Deliver to the County Museum. " So that's where the old knight was headed for. That's using the old noodle. But, like, what happened to our mysterious professor? Well, if he was driving this truck, he's disappeared. Well, gang, it looks like we're up to our armor plates in another mystery. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. I suppose I should thank you for finding the Black Knight. But with Professor Hyde White's mysterious disappearance and all I wish you hadn't. - Why is that, Mr. Wickles? - Because of the legend. - Legend? - Yes. The Black Knight is supposed to come alive when the moon is full. Like, wow! The moon was full last night. Then what was the professor doing with tall, tin, dark and creepy? He was delivering it to the museum. All the way from England. - Where do you want it, Mr. Wickles? - Just put it in the Medieval Room. Right. What's this? Scooby-Doo, where are you? - Come on, Scooby. We're leaving. - Coming. This mystery's got me baffled. Well, it's got me, like, hungry. When do we eat? - Let's eat! - Hey, what's Scooby wearing? They look like some crazy kind of glasses. - He must've found them at the museum. - Yeah, yeah. Man, I wonder what kind of groovy things you see with those. Well, there's one way to find out. Here it is! They're a special type of magnifying glasses used by jewelers, scientists and archeologists. And hold on to your Hula-Hoops. It says here, "made only in England. " - Archeologists? - England? Professor Hyde White! That settles it. There's something fishy going on in that museum. - Museum? - Right, Scooby. Tonight we're going fishing. This place is locked up tighter than a drum. Then, like, how do we get in? Easy. Shaggy goes through that window up there. - Why me? - Because that's a small window -  and you're the thinnest. - Oh, boy. Come on, give me a hand with this ladder. - It won't reach. - I guess we don't get in. Well, if we don't, we'll never find out what happened to the missing professor. Shaggy, you start up, and I'll get the jack out of the Mystery Machine. Right. - Hang on, Shaggy. - Like, right, man. I'll start cranking. And I'll keep hanging on. - That's it, no more jack. - He still can't reach it. Don't worry. Shaggy's the swingingest gymnast in school. When you get in, open the back door. Right. Watch me swing right in. Well, at least we know he's inside. The Black Knight. Sure glad it's empty. Golly, this place sure is creepy at night. It's even creepy during the day. I think we'd better split up. Daphne and I will go this way you two go that way. And, Scooby, stand guard. Would you do it for a Scooby Snack? - Two? - Okay, two it is. Scooby-Doo! Yikes! - I think we're being followed. - Yeah, by Scooby. All right, Scooby-Doo, you can come with us. All right, all right. Down, down. What did you do that for? You know how that full moon turns on that Black Knight. - That's only a superstitious legend. - Well, I'm not taking any chances. I'm with you. Oh, no, we lost Shaggy. I hope we find Shaggy soon. Stop that noise. I've got it! That's better. Come on. What a spooky place. Not now, Scooby. Not now. Now, look what that dog did. He knows I can't see without my glasses. There you are, Shaggy. You sound terrible. I told you to take care of that cold. Lucky I brought your medicine. I can't find that Velma nowheres. Zoinks! This will fix you up in a jiffy. Let's get out of here! See? You sound better already. Scooby-Doo! Scooby-Dooby-Doo! Sorry! Bye-bye! I tell you, the Black Knight is alive and roaming through the hallways. If we could only find a clue. It's Scooby! When Velma said, "clue," she didn't mean you, Scooby. Hey, like, wait a minute. There's a picture missing from the wall. Maybe that's a clue. - We better tell the others. - Right! It's right down here. - There's no picture missing, Shaggy. - Well, it was a minute ago. Some clue. Well, if that's blood that's a clue. It's paint. And look. A trail of it leads down the hallway. Come on, follow that paint. The trail of paint ends here at the mummy case. Come on, Shaggy. Help me open it. Don't like surprises, especially spooky ones. Oh, come on. Hey, look, a secret room. Somebody sure is a messy housekeeper. And look at that. There are two paintings exactly alike. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Right, Velma. This just about solves the mystery. - It does? - What? No time to explain now, Shaggy. We gotta get the sheriff. Let's take this back way out. Leave it to Daphne to pick the wrong door. Zoinks! Scooby, like, do something. Maybe my ventriloquism bit can get us out of this jam. If I can throw my voice to make it sound like it's coming from the room he might leave. Help! Let me out of this pot! - Help! - Help! Scooby-Doo! Zoinks! Scooby! Yikes! Scooby-Doo! We did it, Scooby-Doo. We did it. We did? Scooby-Doo! - Just as we thought! - It's the curator, Mr. Wickles. We've gotta hand it to you kids. We never would have suspected Wickles as the art swindler. Boy, it was a neat setup. He and his gang were switching fake pieces of art for the real ones in the museum. They made the fakes at night, in a secret workshop behind the mummy case. That's why they had to get rid of the professor. He was the only one who could have spotted the fakes. Oh, my gosh! Professor Hyde White! We never found him. - It's Scooby-Doo with a shoe. - Follow me! See? Professor Hyde White! All the time, it was Wickles who made that Black Knight come to life. - Then there was no legend. - Positively not. Wickles just used the story to cover up my mysterious disappearance. Somehow, he managed to get into the armor, down at the train station. And, like, on the way to the museum, he made you disappear. Zoinks! He's alive! Scooby-Doo!
Here it is, gang. Rocky Point Beach. What a groovy spot for a beach party. Yeah, man. I can already taste those chocolate-covered hot dogs. Yuck! His stomach must be made of scrap iron. Can I help it if my first toy was a garbage disposal? Come on, gang. Let's unload. All right. Okay. I'll give Daphne the boxes. Hurry up! Hey, like, where's Scooby-Doo? He's supposed to be helping me. He went surfing. Scooby-Doo! Okay! Come and get it! Oh, no! Hey, what's with Scooby-Doo? Zoinks! A seagoing ghost! Shaggy, come back! Shaggy, come out of that umbrella. No. Did you see what I saw? Yeah, we saw it and we're going back to find out what it was. Swell. I'll wait here. And when you find out, send me a telegram. We won't have to. Look! It's gone! There's something mighty spooky going on around here. Yeah, and I wonder what it is. Hey, gang, listen to this. "Another Boat Mysteriously Vanishes. Sheriff and Coast Guard are baffled by the mysterious disappearances. " "Beach hermit Ebenezer Shark claims it was the ghost of Captain Cutler who stole it. " - Ghost? - Ghost? Do you think that's what we saw last night? I don't know, but maybe that beach hermit Ebenezer Shark can give us a clue. Then let's pay him a visit tonight. Aye! I seen him with me very own eyes. A ghostly glow moving through the fog just before the boats vanish. But what makes you think it was the ghost of Captain Cutler? Because it was on a foggy night such as this that Captain Cutler's boat was wrecked. It collided with one of them fancy yachts from the marina sending Cutler down to the graveyard of ships. But before he disappeared into the sea he shouted that he would return. So by causing the yachts to vanish from the marina -  Cutler's getting his revenge. - Aye. Hey, it's Scooby! Come on! Zoinks! It's that ghost again! That's no ghost! It's just Scooby-Doo! It looks like your pooch found me old diving suit. Diving suit? Aye. Now, if you want to know any more about Cutler I think you'd better see his wife up at the old lighthouse. There's something mighty fishy about Ebenezer Shark. I'll say there is. Yeah. He looks more like a barracuda. Listen, Daph and I will stick around here and keep an eye on old Shark. You three go up to the old lighthouse and talk to Widow Cutler. - Old lighthouse? - Yeah, old lighthouse. What a creepy-looking lighthouse. Okay, Scooby. Go knock on the door. Right. Look at him. What a ham. I guess it's up to you, Velma. It's up to all of us. Now, march! Ladies first. Well, come on! Wow! Like, this place is furnished in early Halloween. It's obvious. She practices witchcraft. Hey, look at these. What zoinky labels. "Ear of a newt"? That? Oh, that's canned hyena laughs. Look. Witchcraft Made Easy. Very interesting. Velma, who do I know with long, skinny hands? Good evening. Zoinks! Mrs. Cutler, I presume? Aye. I was just tending the light and didn't hear you knock. Now, what's your problem? It's about Captain Cutler. We think we saw his ghost. You did, dearie. It was me and my witchcraft that brought Captain Cutler back from his watery grave. Then it's his ghost that's making these yachts vanish? Aye. But had I known he'd take his revenge I'd have left him under the sea. That's good! You'll pardon me doing the wash, dearie. Well, we have to go now. Thanks for your help. Anytime, dearie. Anytime. Am I glad to get out of that scary pad. Me too. Yuck! Now, our next step is to find the ghost. I think he's found us. Look! Come on! After that glow! It's in that drainpipe. Well, it got away, so let's go. Come here! Scooby will go in after it. Oh, that's different. Me? Yes, you. You're the only one that can squeeze into that drainpipe. Too fat. Too fat? Would you squeeze in for a Scooby Snack? Scooby-Doo! Like, wow! Glowing seaweed! It looks like you found a clue, Scooby-Doo. Well, Scooby-Dooby-Doo! Did you find anything? Here it is. Phosphorum pyrifora. Like, speak English. A phosphorus-glowing seaweed found only in the area known as the "graveyard of ships. " That's where Captain Cutler went down. Then maybe that's where we'll find his ghost and the answer to our mystery. But what about Ebenezer Shark? I don't know, but he headed for the marina about an hour ago. I wonder what he's up to. There it is. The graveyard of ships. I don't like it. Hey, look. A bottle. And there's a note inside. Well, what does it say? No deposit, no return. Big help. We're getting close. Keep a sharp lookout for anything suspicious. Look! One of the yachts from the marina! Hey, there's no one aboard and the motor's not running. Then, like, what's making it go? Ghost power. I was afraid you'd say that. Come on. Let's follow it. It's going into that cove, and there's no way out. Hey, something's wrong. It's gone! Vanished into thin air! It's, like, weirdo! Well, like I always say: "Onward and downward. " To the graveyard of ships, that is. We're all set. Except for Scooby. Oh, come down from there! Scooby, there's nothing to be afraid of. I'll get him down. Howdy do! Howdy do, yourself! Help! Like, wow! What a spooky place. It's a perfect home for that seagoing ghost. Well, if we're going to find any ghosts, we'd better split up. You guys go that way and we'll go this way. Okay. Look! What's that? Could that be Captain Cutler? It could be, but there's only one way to find out. Let's go. Well, is it him? No. Look at that old-fashioned diving suit. He's been down here a hundred years. The door! We're trapped! Hey, Shaggy, look. Scuba tanks. Scooby-Doo? Scooby-Doo, where are you? Hey, Shaggy? I found a clue! I found a clue! You found a clue? This cannon is loaded. There's a fuse in it. Fire! Like, no fire. I forgot matches don't light underwater. Hold still, Scooby! I am! Hey, scram! Shoo! Go! Nice going! We thought we'd never get out of this creepy cabin. Well, like, we never thought we'd lose that ghost. Then you saw him too? He's the one that locked us in. So we haven't had a chance to find any clues. I found a clue! I found a clue! You? You found a clue? Follow me. It's a secret storehouse of scuba tanks. Yeah, and all ready to use. Things are beginning to add up. You mean like two and two are five? More than that. I'd like to get a close look at that ghost. How can we? He's gone. But his trail's not. Look. Glowing footprints. Now all we gotta do is follow them. The footprints vanish right into the side of the cliff. Well, if my sense of direction is right this is the same area where that yacht from the marina vanished. Now what do we do? Like, rest. I'm pooped. Hey! I'm sinking! Look! A secret passage! You're right! Shaggy, you're a genius! - I am? - Sure. Who else but you could've sat down on the rock that opened the secret passage? I thought that rock was pretty suspicious. Come on, gang. Let's go inside. We're in a giant underground cavern! Man! Lookie there! Like, get a load of those yachts. Yeah, and they're being painted over in different colors. Hey, look at that yacht. It's the one that vanished in the cove. And look! It's tied to a minisub. It's just as we suspected and these clues prove it. Then I guess this wraps up our mystery. That is, if we can wrap up the ghost. Not wrap him up, Shaggy, suds him up. Hurry up, Fred. No telling when "glowing gruesome" will show up. I'm ready with the fire hose. Okay, everybody? I hope your contraption works. It's a cinch. We put a bar of soap in this spray container. Attach it to this fire hose turn on the water, and instant suds. And see that ramp? The ghost comes down it, we suds it up, he slips and we hose him right over into that net. Then we hoist him high as a Christmas goose. Okay, gang. Start Operation Noisemaker. Here he comes. Let him have it! Scooby! He can't see where he's going! Scooby, are you all right? Now, let's see if our mystery ghost diver is really Ebenezer Shark. - It's not him. - Then who is it? I got it! Does this seaweed help remind you of that picture on Widow Cutler's wall? Captain Cutler! Hey, listen to this, gang. "Teenage Sleuths Solve Boat Hijacking Mystery. Captain Cutler and his wife taken into custody by sheriff. " That was some plan they had. First, spreading the phony story about Cutler and then stealing the yachts from the marina. That night on the beach, Cutler was storing extra scuba tanks in the graveyard of ships. Yeah, but, like, his diving suit got covered with that kooky glowing seaweed. That's where the glowing ghost story came from. Well, that closes the mystery. How did Scooby do that? I guess that's another mystery.
You sure picked a spooky day to go boating, Freddy. It didn't start out that way. What could have happened? It's very simple. When the barometric pressure dropped and warm air came in contact with an inland cold front we ran into some unnavigable nubilation. You're right, Velma, whatever you said. - I said, we're lost in a fog. - You buzzed? No, Shaggy. Go back to sleep. Sleep, nothing. I'm fixing me a super Shaggy sandwich. Like, wow, my favorite: A double-triple-decker sardine and marshmallow-fudge sandwich. Open the mouth, between the gums. Look out, stomach. Here it comes. Well, at least you left me the olive. With him around, I can't even get a bite in edgewise. - Now what happened? - Looks like we've run aground. - Yeah, but, like, where? - Well, if I'm not mistaken it looks like we're stuck on Haunted Isle. I'm sorry I asked. The old Vasquez Castle's on this island. Maybe we can find help there. - This sure is a creepy place. - Yeah, a regular gruesome camp. Like, what's with Scooby-Doo? Hey, if you wanna play in the sand, Scooby, leave us out of it, huh? Hey, what's this? It's a torn piece of map. D- A-N-G-E-R. Danger? Hey! Look, it's, like, a message! It says, "Danger. Leave Haunted Isle. " It sure looks like someone is trying to scare us off this island. But who? And why? I don't know, but it looks like we found ourselves a mystery and maybe we'll find the answer at that castle. - Come on, let's go! - Oh, boy! Well, here it is. Old Vasquez Castle. Man, what a pad for a scare-in. The place looks deserted. That's Vasquez, the pirate. He sailed the seas in 1612. He must have used this old castle for a hideout. Come on. Let's take a look around. Man, like, plenty spooky! I once read these old castles were loaded with traps. Oh, Velma, don't be silly. That only happens in movies! - Daphne! Daphne! - What happened? Daphne fell through a trap door! Come on. We gotta find Daphne. But what about that: It was probably just the wind. That's the first wind I heard with a sense of humor. - Come on, put your nose to work. - Right. Let me out of here! Let me out of here! Wow! I wonder how I get out of this creepy inner sanctum. Well, my intuition tells me that way. Stop that whistling. You make me nervous. Like, which way did they go? - They went thattaway. - Oh, thanks, man. It's all right. - Like, wow! A talking skull. - Like, wow! I'm so scared. I wish I had a ham sandwich to calm my nerves. Well, what do you know, a ham sandwich! Wouldn't you know, it needs some mustard. This has gotta be my imagination. Otherwise, I'd be scared. Now, maybe my imagination can, like, cut it in half. Someone's coming. Shaggy! Hi, Daphne. Hey, look. Shaggy found Daphne. For once, he used his head. - Are you all right? - Yeah. Just as soon as I have six or seven sandwiches. He's all right, all right. There goes that crazy wind again. Crazy wind, nothing. Look! I warn you. Leave Haunted Isle and never return. The phantom has spoken. Grab that phantom! Did you see that? Yeah! Like, he went through the wall, nonstop. - There's a logical explanation for this. - Quick, tell me. - The place is haunted. - Thanks a lot. Why don't we take that phantom man's advice and clear out of this place? No, Shag. We're not going. - Like, why not? - Three good reasons, Shaggy. First, no phantom's gonna scare us away. Second, why does he want us off this island so bad? - And third, we're marooned. - I'll buy that last one. Hey, fellas, over here. A clue. I found a key in this chest. It must belong to the phantom. Hey, there's some writing on it. It says, "Second passage of the old bell. " - Second passage? - Old bell? There's no old bell in this castle. I've got it. "Passage" must mean a passage in a book. Then The Old Bell must be the name of a book! That's right. And the best place to find a book is in the library. Right. Come on! This is the book called The Old Bell. Look, in the second passage, the word "catacombs" is underlined in red. If my knowledge is correct, we should find catacombs in the basement. This is the place. Okay, Scooby. Go in and take a look around. We'll keep watch out here. No, I'm not kidding. There he goes with his fake-wounded routine. What a ham. Would you do it for a Scooby Snack? How about two? - Three? - Okay, three. Scooby says it's okay. Man, look at all that crazy magic stuff. A saw-them-in-two box, disappearing cabinets, levitating tables. Gosh! But what's all this magic stuff doing here? I think I'm beginning to figure it out. Somebody's coming! Quick! Into the closet! Hurry! Whoever it was must've gone away. Look! The phantom! I warned you to leave the island! Now you will pay! I'll pay! I'll pay! How about 4 bits? Not that kind of pay. Let's get out of here! Help! Help! - Shaggy! - Help! Shaggy! Hey, this is just a dummy head! Someone mention me? - Hey, look! - A magic carpet! I hope this trick works. Ali, go oop. Wait for me! - Well, we've lost him. - Groovy. - Now we gotta catch him. - Not groovy. If we're ever gonna solve this mystery - But how? - Simple, and with just a few things. That suit of armor and crossbow that cannonball and old spring I gotta hand it to you, Fred. You really know how to build a better mousetrap. In this case, a better phantom trap. But what good is it? We can't catch a phantom. I have a hunch that we can, right, Velma? Check, but first we'll have to find him and lure him here. - But how do we find the phantom? - We don't. Scooby does. Scooby does? Right. With your super-sleuth nose, you'll be able to sniff him out. Well, look at him. My nose. Cold in my nose. Cut it out. You don't have a cold in your nose. How do we know the phantom will chase Scooby-Doo? - He's a dog. - Don't worry. We'll soon fix that. Come on, Scooby. Be brave. Just think of Rin Din Din. Lassie. John Wayne. John Wayne? - John Wayne? - Sure, Scooby. Scooby-Doo! Like I said before, what a ham. Phantom! Phantom! Not here. You cannot escape me. Get ready! Here they come! Jump, Scooby! Oh, no! Scooby tripped into our trap. Now you will not escape me. - We caught the phantom! - Thanks to Scooby-Doo! When the fog lifted, we spotted your beached boat and decided to investigate. - But who is that? - This? This is the end of the mystery. Well, if it isn't our old friend Bluestone the Great -  an ex-magician wanted in six states. - But what is he doing here? He must have heard the legend of the Vasquez treasure. Everybody's after it. I get it. He used his magic tricks to keep people away from the island -  while he searched for it. - When he saw us -  he tried to scare us away. - Well, his scaring days are over. He's going to do a final disappearing act courtesy of the local jail. There's one more thing. We figured out all those floating tricks. - Look, no hands! - See? Wires. But how did you walk right through a solid wall? One of my best acts. Let me give one last performance. Hold this rope. It was merely an illusion done with trick mirrors and a special projector. I could cast my image anywhere I wanted and by stepping away from the mirror, it appears that I walk through walls. I must admit, Mr. Bluestone you're a good magician, but a bad phantom. Man, I wonder if, like, there really is a treasure. That's Scooby barking. Come on! - Look! Scooby found something. - Maybe it's the treasure. Well, Scooby-dee-Doo.
Are you sure we took the right turn, Shaggy? Sure. We took this road and turned to the right. No wonder we're lost. You've been reading the map upside down. Here's where we are. At Gold City, the old ghost town. - Ghost town? - Ghost town? What will we do now? What's that over there? "Gold City Guest Ranch. Vacancy. " Maybe we can spend the night there. - There? - Yes, there. Go ahead. Ring the bell, Shaggy. Ring-a-ding-ding, coming up. Welcome, kids. Come on in. I'm Big Ben, owner of this guest ranch. Do you happen to have any rooms? Do I? You're my only guests. Come on in and register and I'll call old Hank. Hank. Oh, Hank. We have some guests. Hey, Scooby, come here. Now, this is Hank, the caretaker here at the ranch. Pleased to meet you. Hank, show the guests to their rooms, like a good feller. Follow me. That will be the girls' room and you fellers can bunk in this one, just across the hall. These sure are nice rooms. I can't understand why the place is empty. It's the miner. - The miner? - The who? The Miner Forty-Niner. - Forty-Niner? - Yes siree. He came to Gold City in 1849 and he can't rest until he finds the last vein of gold. Like, wow, that's what I call an ancient miner. That's for sure. And at night, you can hear the mine moaning calling for the miner. But what has he got to do with the ranch? I don't know but lately, he's been coming up here and scaring the guests away. And I'm going away in the morning myself. Man, that's the wildest tale I ever heard. Ridiculous. A 100-year-old miner. Still, something must have scared off the guests. Gone! Well, it's still early. Why don't we go into the ghost town and take a look around? Wonder what it's like on a Saturday night. Boy, what a spooky old street. I've seen enough. Let's go back. Not until we walk around this ghost town and see what we can find. Like, I know what we'll find. - What? - Ghosts. Hey, look, Shaggy. A real old-time Western saloon. When you said old, you just weren't, like, kidding. - Sarsaparilla, bartender. - Two. No wonder this place is empty. You ask for a sarsaparilla, and all you get is a glass of spider webs. Spider webs? - Zoinks, ghosts! - Ghosts? It's not a ghost. It's a player piano. So who's playing it? It's automatic. It must've turned itself on automatically. Now, come down out of those draperies. Like, why couldn't you have been a poodle? Did you find any clues? - Not a one. - Neither did I. Let's take a look in this old hotel. Maybe our mysterious miner rented a room for the night. - Oh, go on in, Scooby. - Yikes! What a creaky, creepy place. Hey, Scooby, come on. Oh, wait for me. It's lucky for you the room's empty. Let's get back to the others. He's got me! Help! It's only a tree branch. I knew it all the time. The only place we haven't looked is the old mine. And that's all boarded up. I'm beginning to think there really isn't an ancient miner. Well, let's keep moving. Keep together, now. Zoinks! The miner's chasing Scooby! Some miner. It's only a cigar-store Indian. Oh, Scooby. Quit clowning. Who's clowning? Look. It's hollow. Hey, what's this inside? It looks like a map of Gold City. And look how new it is. What's a new map like that doing in an old Indian like this? It's quite simple. - Somebody was hiding it. - Maybe these numbers mean something. Left 10, right 7, left 4, right 23. Maybe it's directions to a buried treasure. Yeah. Like a fortune in buried chocolate cheeseburgers. But those directions don't make sense. - Then they must mean something. - But what? I've got it. I bet it's the combination of a safe. And there's an old safe in the lobby of this hotel. Shaggy, you work on the combination as I read off the numbers. Okay, but I need a moment to warm up. Now, I must have absolute quiet while I work. - Oh, Shaggy. Shaggy. - Quiet. Look, I have the combination. Just turn the knob to the right. Well, why didn't you say so? It's open. Stop showing off, Scooby. I knew it was open all the time. - Like, wow. Get a load of that. - A secret elevator. Well, let's see where it goes. All aboard. Come on, Scooby. Come on, Scooby. You're not chicken. Would you come with us for a Scooby snack? - Two? - Okay. Two it is. Well, come on. Scooby-Doo. Down. Wow. Look where we've landed. A mine tunnel. It must be the old Gold City Mine. Well, if there is a miner, this is where we'll find him. Come on. It's sure dark in here. We could use some light. Hey, I found some candles. Shaggy, that's dynamite! Dynamite? That's strange. This end of the mine's lit by lanterns. Yeah, and I wonder who lit them. Zoinks. You had to ask. That must be the moan that Hank was talking about. I think we better split up and try and find where that moan came from. I'll go with Daphne and Velma. - You go with Scooby-Doo. - Thanks a lot. And, Shaggy, if you find anything, holler. I'm liable to holler even if I don't find anything. Yipe! What are you trying to do, Scooby? Well, quit the clowning and come on. Look at all these doors. Look in one of those, I'll look in this one. Right. You gotta be kidding. I suppose you want me to look. Yep, yep, yep, yep. That's what I was afraid of. - It's empty. - Huh? Empty? What are you trying to do, scare me again? What now? Boy, what a scaredy-dog. You still think there's something in that closet? Okay. We'll switch. You look in this door, and I'll look in that one. And there better be something in it. Oh, no! Zoinks! It's the Miner Forty-Niner! This must be a storeroom. Careful. Those old floors look weak. I know. I know. Look out! Are you all right? Say something. I'm all right, just covered with flour. You wait up there. I'll be right up. We gotta, like, find a place to hide. Quick, in here. Zoinks! A ghost. Let's get out of here. We finally got away from that goony miner. It's him! Look out! Are you guys all right? Groovy. Hey, what happened to Daphne? I fell down in here. Wouldn't you know it? Danger-prone Daphne fell into a mineshaft. - I'll get her. - You'll get her? It's the Miner Forty-Niner. Hey, gang. There's a maze of secret passages down there. And guess what I saw in that mine. Yeah. We saw him too. I guess Hank wasn't kidding about that ancient miner. Do you suppose that's the miner moaning? Well, like, if I had a face like that, I'd moan too. Hey, look. I found a clue. It seems that this wire leads up to that speaker. Now things are beginning to make a little sense. And I have a hunch what we'll find at the other end of this wire. I was right. A tape recorder. Well, that accounts for the mysterious moaning. Hey, look what I found. Like, jars of chocolate syrup. Chocolate syrup, nothing. That's samples of crude oil. Oil? In a gold mine? Hey, this mystery is really getting mysterious. And what about our mysterious miner? I've got a hunch he'll show up soon. Let's borrow this microphone. And, Shaggy, we'll need you too. Listen to that Shaggy go. And Scooby's great at being a train. Got him. Oh, no. Scooby can't stop. Scooby went right through the shack. - He's caught him. - I hope. Hey, that's gotta be the miner. But where's Scooby? Help! Look, stilts. Shaggy's right. He is wearing stilts. Then this can only be one person. - Hank. - Hank? Oh, dagnabit. So it was old Hank who was scaring off my guests. To force you out of business. That way, he could buy the guest ranch, the ghost town- And, like, the mine for almost nothing. Then there must still be gold in that old mine. Not gold. Black gold. - You mean oil? - Like, right. But how did Hank know about the oil? He accidentally found the secret mine entrance in the old hotel safe. And instead of gold, he found oil. He had the exact location laid out on a map. Then he, like, hid the map in the cigar-store Indian for safekeeping. Too bad. We could have been partners. Now, instead of being rich, he's in jail. Hey, like, what happened to Scooby? There he is. Scooby, look out for that gopher hole. Scooby-Doo! One of those apples better be for me.
Oh, boy! Hello. Help! Help! Stop! Stop! Come back here! Help! My princess has been dognapped! Dognapped? - That sounds like Scooby-Doo. - He's sure in a hurry. Scooby-Doo, what's with you? Here's a bulletin just in. Flash! The dognappers have struck again. The third prize dog kidnapped in the last three days. Wow! Like, a canine crime wave! Here's another bulletin. Buck Masters, the owner of the first dog stolen has just offered a $500 reward. Gang, we've just been handed our next mystery. - And, we'll begin with Mr. Buck Masters. - Yeah, yeah, yeah! That's right. I've decided not to pay the ransom. I'd rather use the money to catch those crooks. I was sure to win first prize at the county dog show this year. Now Bob Miller's Great Dane is a shoo-in. - Great Dane? - Did you say Great Dane? Yes. Bob's been grooming his dog for this show all year. But if that's the case, isn't the Great Dane in danger? - He could be dognapped. - Don't worry. I warned Bob. And he only takes the dog out for exercise at night and then only on Beach Boulevard near the police station. It seems safe enough there. From now on, all dog owners must be on their guard. Mr. Masters, we're gonna find out who's stealing those dogs and why. Yep. Dognappers, beware. Frankly, I don't see what you kids can do. I don't have a lead to give you. That's all right, Mr. Masters. We have a plan. We do? See this picture of the champion? This will help a lot. Come on, Freddy. Tell us, like, what's the plan? - Yeah. - Simple. We'll give the dognappers a decoy. And then when they grab the decoy, we'll trail them to their hideout. - But what if we lose the dognappers? - Not a chance. We'll plant this tiny transmitter in the decoy's collar. Our direction finder will do the rest. Yeah, but who's the decoy? Scooby-Doo? Scooby's got a point there. Who'd dognap Scooby for ransom? We'll fix that, and Scooby will be brave. Won't you, Scooby? Now, here's a Scooby snack for courage. Shaggy, why'd you do that? Because I know who's stuck with the job of taking the decoy on a leash. Not bad. Not bad at all. Now here's a snack for you, Scooby. Okay, the decoys are fed. Now let's get down to work. What are we doing, solving mysteries or running a beauty parlor for pooches? Hold it, Scooby. Wait till I get your new collar on. Now, how do you like that? Well, Bob Miller said we could take his place tonight, Scooby. - So come on, champ, let's walk. - Scooby-Doo! Hey, take it easy. Slow down! Come on, Scooby. You're a decoy, remember? Keep your mind on your work. Sorry. Now, cut that out. Keep going. Keep going. Boy! At least you don't have to take another bath. Lucky for you, I'm a dog lover. Wow! Look at that truck smoke! No! No! No! Scooby! They got him! Help! Help! Help! I'm coming, Scooby! I'm coming! I'll never catch him this way. Charlie! Charlie! You got any wheels I can borrow? This is an emergency! Just my motor scooter. Thanks, man! Well, this is Beach Boulevard. But no sign of Shaggy and Scooby. That transmitter on Scooby's collar is moving awfully fast. The dognappers must have Scooby. Okay, this is it. Here we go! Help! Help! Oh, no! Man! It's Geronimo! - I got him, boss. - So you got Miller's Great Dane. Good work, Mike. Let's have a look. You fool! That's not Bob Miller's champion Great Dane! How could you mistake this mutt for a show dog? Gee, boss. He was right where you said he'd be. Get this phony decoy out of here! But what will I do with him? Give him a ride down the mountain on the old handcar. By the time it stops, he'll be 20 miles away. - Come on. Back in the crate. - No! No! And when this weirdo Indian attacked I felt like a late-show rerun of Custer's last stand. Are you sure it was a real Indian? Real? Why, when he waved that tomahawk, even my hair was scared. Well, no hoof prints in the road, but here's something I found. It's an authentic Indian relic, at least 1000 years old. I told you I thought he looked kind of ghostly. Hold it, gang. The transmitter on Scooby's collar is moving again. And it looks like it's heading for Indian Gap. Let's plot an intercept course. Oh, no! Poor Scooby! As a decoy, you're a dud. Well, so long, pooch. Enjoy the ride. Hey! That was Scooby! Hey, Scooby-Doo! Hang on, Scooby! We'll save you! Hurry, Freddy! Give her the gas! One for the money, two for the show three to get ready, and here I go! We're on a trestle. Boy, was that close! As soon as we slow down, Scooby, I'll get you out of that crate. What's that? Sounds like the midnight express. It is! I hope this is the brake! It's rusty. It's not holding. I'll help! I'll help! Watch it! - Faster! Faster! - I'm going faster! - Here they come! - That train is awfully close! There was a switch by the crossroad. Come on! Let's go! Scooby, you're a brave decoy. Did those old dognappers hurt you, Scooby? This is all very nice, but it doesn't solve the mystery. Scooby, can you tell us where the dognappers took you? Yeah! Yeah! Oh, no! Not the Indian! Not the ghost of Geronimo! Yeah! Yeah! Geronimo! Well, we've only got one lead. And that's to backtrack to that old railroad spur. Everybody game? We can get along without the sound effect, thank you. - Geronimo! - Geronimo! Stop the car! Stop the car! Head for the rocks. - He's gone. - Let's get back to the handcar. This is real, like in the movies. I told you that Indian was for real. Well, this arrow isn't for real. It's factory-made. Then how about that? Is that for real? Looks deserted, but somebody's up there. - Nobody's getting my beautiful hair. - Me either. Gang, we've got to get up to that Indian village. And I think I know how we can do it. Now, we're all ready. This giant slingshot will shoot the arrow up to the village taking the rope with it. Then everybody climbs up, okay? Okay, it's solid. Now, let's get up to that village. - Not me. - Scooby, you come back here. Man, this is spooksville. - Like, Indian-style. - Yeah. Spooksville. Okay, gang. Let's explore. - What's that? - Look! Up there! Leave this place, paleface intruders or suffer fate of Spanish conquistadores buried in desert below! That's him! That's him! Remember my warning and go! That Indian sure spoke good English considering he's supposed to be - Maybe he went to night school. - Okay, everybody. We'll head for the dome-shaped building. - Hey, where's Scooby? - He'll catch up to us. Let's move on. Wait for me! - Hey! Come on! Get away from me! - Get out of here! Leave me alone! Go away! If I ever get out of this, we'll call this dance the Batusi. My glasses! - Get out of here, bats! - My glasses! I can't see without them! - I'm getting out of here. - But I've just got to find my glasses! - Hi, Shaggy. - Hi, Scooby. Boy, I sure am glad to get away from those bats. - It's Geronimo! - Geronimo! - Shaggy? - Yipes! It's you, Scooby. Hey, what are you doing with Velma's glasses? Come on. The coast is clear. Where is everybody? Why, Shaggy, you're petrified with fear. And you too, Scooby. Help me find my glasses. Here they are, Velma. - Where did you find them? - It's a long story, Velma. Long story. This looks like their ceremonial building where they held their special rites. - Perfect place for a witch doctor to live. - Yeah. Come on. Let's find him. Hey, look! I doubt if that fire's been burning 1000 years. Freddy, this place gives me goose bumps. You have violated the sacred temple. If you do not leave this village now you will remain here forever. - Okay, we found him. Now let's go. - Not yet. - I want to check that altar. - You check it. - I'll wait right here. - Okay, I'll just be a moment. Daphne? She's gone! Daphne! Daphne! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food? Good boy. Where is it? Lead me to it. What's it smell like, Indian corn? Beef jerky? I'll try anything. Man! Those Pueblo Indians sure knew how to live. We have salami, ham, canned sardines, pudding, not to men- Hey, wait a minute. - This isn't Indian food. - Dog food. - Scooby food. - Scooby food? - Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! - It is dog food. Scooby, we found the dognappers' hideout. But I don't see any dognappers around. So why not fortify ourselves with a groovy little snack? And the ham slice connected to the rye bread. Lettuce connected to the boiled egg. Mustard slapped on a salami slice. And the cheese connected to the deviled ham. Hey, what's this? Scooby-Doo, where are you? Scooby, untie me, quick! That witch doctor may come back at any time. - And the dogs? - The dogs? Oh, sure. We'll free the dogs. Now, hurry! I got a hunch there's a secret passage around here someplace. There it is! - Velma! What are you doing there? - I don't know. I sat down to rest, the next minute I'm here. Freddy! Velma! Quick! This way! Good boy, Scooby! You found them and freed them all! Does this mean we've solved the dognapping mystery? Not yet. Hey, Scooby, see if any of your pals know anything about that witch doctor or the dognapper. Okay. - You know where he is, Scooby? - Yeah! Yeah! Okay, let's go. We're right behind you. While I'm searching for Scooby, I'll just finish this little morsel. Yipe! What a close shave! That was almost a catastrophe. Hey, Shaggy! Come on! Follow the dogs! Come on, Shaggy! Scooby-Doo! They've spotted him! The dogs have him! Why, it's Buck Masters, the owner of Big Red. - He's the dognapper! - You blasted kids! Why didn't you mind your own business? Catching dognappers is our business, Mr. Masters. After all, Scooby-Doo is a dog. And we love him very much. That was quite a plot you kids uncovered. Who would have suspected Masters of dognapping his own pet? He decided to win the dog show by dognapping the only three dogs who could beat Big Red. Then Big Red was to turn up just before the show and win first prize. You said something about a phantom Indian on horseback. - What about that? - Simple. He used a movie projector from the back of his truck. Look! Geronimo! He's back again! Scooby-Doo!
Come. Come. Come. Come. Well, we're almost to the Wetherby estate, gang. It sure is nice of Sharon to ask us up here for the weekend. There's so many groovy things to do. Yeah, like swimming and eating, and tennis and eating, and riding and eating and eating and- How do you like that? Hey, look up there. Jeepers, someone's going into that old mansion. Like, wow. Who'd do a kooky thing like that? I don't know. Gee, it's sure good to see all of you. But I hope this wasn't the wrong weekend for you to come. - Why's that, Sharon? - Well, the last few nights we've been hearing a lot of strange noises. And now it looks like my Uncle Stuart has vanished. Could it have been him we saw going into that old mansion? You mean the Kingston mansion? Maybe we'd better go up there and see. Uncle Stuart? Uncle Stuart? Like, you know, there's no sign of him anywhere. Look, someone's in the shadows. Uncle Stuart. He's become an old man. What happened, Stuart? It started when a ghostly voice called out from the old mansion. I had to obey it. It drew me out of the house. I was in a trance. I went past the Kingston mausoleum and finally into the old mansion. And there is where I saw the ghost of Elias Kingston. The Wetherby fortune belongs to me. Unless it is returned to this mansion before morning the entire family shall suffer this terrible fate. That's when he made me an old man, as a warning to you all. What are we going to do? First of all, I'm going to call the sheriff. That's strange. The phone's dead. Why don't you go get the sheriff, Mr. Wetherby. We'll wait here. We'll keep an eye on Stuart until you get back. - You sure you'll be all right? - Sure. And just to make sure nothing else happens we'll all take turns standing guard. Who's gonna stand the first watch? Who else? The watchdog. Right. The watchdog. - That's me? - That's right. That's you. Just think, Scooby, no ghostly voice will get past your keen sense of hearing. That old hard-of-hearing trick isn't gonna work tonight, Scooby. Come. Come. Where'd he go? Hey, what's with the bugle call, Scooby? It looks like Uncle Stuart's gone again. He's not the only one. Sharon's gone too. - But, like, where? - We'd better get up to that old mansion. And fast. I don't see any sign of Sharon, Uncle Stuart or the ghost. Like, maybe we're in luck and he's out haunting another house. Say, what have you got on your feet, roller skates? - Why are you wearing those things? - I'm not taking any chances. If we do see that ghost, he'll never catch me. Come on, let's keep looking. I wonder if ghosts can hide in little pots. I guess not. Scooby-Doo! Oh, boy, oh, boy. How soggy can a guy get? If there's one thing I can't stand, it's taking a bath in a haunted house. Whether you know it or not, Scooby, you found our first clue. I did? Sure. Who ever heard of a ghost needing a watchdog to scare anybody away? Like, you mean there isn't any ghosts? Well, I haven't seen any. Yet. And we haven't seen Sharon or her uncle either. Hey, was Uncle Stuart wearing a blue suit, red tie and tennis shoes? Yeah, when we last saw him. Then I think we found him. Only he looks a little older now. I guess that ghost wasn't kidding. That's just about as old as you can get. It sure would help if we could find another clue. I found one. - Groovy. What is it? - Him. It's the ghost! Ghost? This is the last warning. Either the fortune is here by morning or all those in the Wetherby house shall grow old. Now go. Old Horrible really said a frightful mouthful. - But we're not gonna let that scare us. - We're not? No, Shaggy. We're gonna solve this mystery. Hey, where's Scooby? I bet he's in that closet. "Out to lunch. " Can you imagine? Yeah, with Scooby, I wouldn't be surprised. How do you like that? He didn't even invite me. Hey, that was the ghost. Yeah, he went into the mausoleum. Come on, let's see what he's up to. Okay, Shaggy. Use Velma's fingerprinting kit and dust for prints. Right, Freddy. I'll give it the old Sherlock Holmes touch. Like, wow. Look at all them fingerprints. Not my hand, silly. That door. Freddy, we got something. Just as I thought. Fingerprints. Wait a minute. Ghosts wouldn't leave fingerprints. - Like, maybe he can turn into a bat. - Don't be silly. Okay, Scooby, go in there and sniff around for that ghost. Would you do it for a Scooby Snack? I'll give you one. How about two? Three. Four? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll go. Scooby-Dooby-Doo! Like, there's times I'll do anything for a Scooby Snack. It's okay. Come on in. - There's no ghost in here. - Well, we know he came in. There's something on that table. This might be a clue. A book on crystalomacy. Crystal O'Macy? I used to know a Crystal Nerdlinger. It's not a girl, silly. It's a book about how to use a crystal ball. - You mean the kind a fortuneteller uses? - Right. Say, there's an old swami place in town. Maybe there's some kind of a connection. Zoinks, the door! Hey, we're locked in. Well, let's hope there's a secret way out of here. Start tapping on the walls. Hey. Like, what happened to Scooby? He was right there a second ago. It's a secret passage. You did it, Scooby. You found the way out. I did? Well, Scooby-Dooby-Doo! That secret passage was a shortcut to the Wetherby estate. I wonder if it has to do with Sharon's disappearance. I don't know. But maybe we'll find the answer here at the swami's place. It looks like the swami's out swami-ing somewhere else. I guess he won't mind if we take a look around. I wonder what's in here. Daphne, not the storage closet. Well, Daphne, you did it again. Like, someone's coming. Yoo-hoo. Swami. Oh, Swami. Oh, there you are. - Oh, no. A customer. - And she thinks Scooby's the swami. Shaggy, you better throw your voice and make Scooby sound like a swami. - Yeah, I better. - Mr. Swami, I have something to ask you. Good evening. Please be seated. Oh, swami, tell me, what do you see in the crystal ball? - My reflection. - Your reflection? My word. No, wait. I see a tall, handsome man in your future. And you're dancing together cheek to cheek. Now he's whispering something to you. - He is? What is the dear boy saying? - "Get off my foot. " Enough of this. I want my palm read. Yes, ma'am. You did say "red. " How dare you! How about that? All that advice and she didn't even pay us a dime. I hope that's the end of the customers for a while. Okay, gang. Let's get on with our investigation. Hey, look. The table's floating. Zoinks! It's the gooney ghost! You did not do as I said. Now you shall pay. Hey, look out! Duck! It's after us! Here it comes again. I've heard of flying saucers, but this is silly. Run. Run. Run. We got rid of it. We did? Then, like, what's that? - He's a real joker. - I'm not laughing. Duck! Look out, Scooby! Scooby caught the table. Man, this flew like it was jet-propelled. You mean like fan-propelled. See? A fan-type motor underneath gave it the power. Are you okay, Scooby? I'm okay. Hey, look, suitcases. Maybe somebody just moved in. Then let's move out. And look what I found: A professional makeup kit. And what's that? It looks like a TV camera. You're right, Shaggy. Yeah. It's a miniature TV camera. Hey, smile, Scooby. That's how the ghost got on the crystal ball: Closed-circuit TV. See, Scooby? That's how you look on TV. What a ham. Well, we got a lot of clues. - We do? - She's right. Enough clues to turn the tables on that ghost. Now, here's what we're gonna do. Yoo-hoo, Mr. Ghost! I'm here with the fortune. Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo! Good. You brought the fortune. How fortunate for you. Stay until I see with my own eyes. It's a trick. I'll turn you to bones! The plan's working, Scooby. - You can't get away! - Quick, get behind the curtain. Scooby, I hope the ghost doesn't find us. Perfecto. I got my shoes, now let's join the gang. I can hear the ghost coming. Get ready for phase two. - All set, Shaggy? - Yeah. Let's go. - He's in the hall. - Turn on the projector. Stop, or I'll mummify you! Wait. Hold it. This place is really haunted. Now watch what he does when he sees the tape of you, Scooby. Oh, no! That does it. It's working, Sharon. He's going into the secret room, where he had me tied up. Well, Miss Sharon, I still have you, and the fortune shall yet be mine- How did that get here? Let me out of here. Here he comes. Golly, he's running like a ghost was after him. - Now. Throw it! - Bombs away! I guess that about wraps up the ghost story. Scooby-Dooby-Doo! Mr. Wetherby, this ghost really doesn't need any introduction. As soon as we clean him up I'm sure you'll recognize him. There. Look familiar? - Uncle Stuart. - Like, in person. He thought he could scare you into giving up the family fortune. That ghostly wailing was only a recording. And by a clever use of makeup, he made himself look old. When I came downstairs to investigate a noise, I saw Uncle Stuart's wig blow off. - I knew he wasn't old. - So he had to take you prisoner. But where does the swami come in? What better way for a swindler to disappear? Uncle Stuart, why did you do it? Well, I guess he can explain it to the sheriff when he gets here. - I bet you kids are starving. - Groovy. Zoinks, that's for me. Hey, what's this? "Scooby-Doo was here. " The whole turkey? Gone? Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
