What a nervous night to be walking home from the movies, Scooby-Doo. And all because you had to stay and see Star: Dog Ranger of the North Woods twice. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! - What's that? - It's coming from the bushes. Go see what it is, Scooby. - Don't worry, I'm right behind you. - Thanks a lot. Oh, well. Scooby, come back! Wait! Where he go? Where he go? - Like, next time, signal. - Sorry. Hey, what's that? Looks like a deserted-type pickup truck. Anyone home? You're right, Shaggy. This sure is strange. Yeah. What's an empty, old suit of armor doing in the driver's seat of this pickup? Maybe he went out for the knight. Get it? - Very funny. - Gosh I wonder who this creepy hunk of tin belongs to. Well, the name on the crate says, "Jameson Hyde White Professor of Archeology. London, England. " - Hyde White? - I've heard of hide-and-seek before but I've never heard of Hyde White. That's an English name, you comedians. Hey, what's this? It's a delivery label that says: "Deliver to the County Museum. " So that's where the old knight was headed for. That's using the old noodle. But, like, what happened to our mysterious professor? Well, if he was driving this truck, he's disappeared. Well, gang, it looks like we're up to our armor plates in another mystery. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. I suppose I should thank you for finding the Black Knight. But with Professor Hyde White's mysterious disappearance and all I wish you hadn't. - Why is that, Mr. Wickles? - Because of the legend. - Legend? - Yes. The Black Knight is supposed to come alive when the moon is full. Like, wow! The moon was full last night. Then what was the professor doing with tall, tin, dark and creepy? He was delivering it to the museum. All the way from England. - Where do you want it, Mr. Wickles? - Just put it in the Medieval Room. Right. What's this? Scooby-Doo, where are you? - Come on, Scooby. We're leaving. - Coming. This mystery's got me baffled. Well, it's got me, like, hungry. When do we eat? - Let's eat! - Hey, what's Scooby wearing? They look like some crazy kind of glasses. - He must've found them at the museum. - Yeah, yeah. Man, I wonder what kind of groovy things you see with those. Well, there's one way to find out. Here it is! They're a special type of magnifying glasses used by jewelers, scientists and archeologists. And hold on to your Hula-Hoops. It says here, "made only in England. " - Archeologists? - England? Professor Hyde White! That settles it. There's something fishy going on in that museum. - Museum? - Right, Scooby. Tonight we're going fishing. This place is locked up tighter than a drum. Then, like, how do we get in? Easy. Shaggy goes through that window up there. - Why me? - Because that's a small window -  and you're the thinnest. - Oh, boy. Come on, give me a hand with this ladder. - It won't reach. - I guess we don't get in. Well, if we don't, we'll never find out what happened to the missing professor. Shaggy, you start up, and I'll get the jack out of the Mystery Machine. Right. - Hang on, Shaggy. - Like, right, man. I'll start cranking. And I'll keep hanging on. - That's it, no more jack. - He still can't reach it. Don't worry. Shaggy's the swingingest gymnast in school. When you get in, open the back door. Right. Watch me swing right in. Well, at least we know he's inside. The Black Knight. Sure glad it's empty. Golly, this place sure is creepy at night. It's even creepy during the day. I think we'd better split up. Daphne and I will go this way you two go that way. And, Scooby, stand guard. Would you do it for a Scooby Snack? - Two? - Okay, two it is. Scooby-Doo! Yikes! - I think we're being followed. - Yeah, by Scooby. All right, Scooby-Doo, you can come with us. All right, all right. Down, down. What did you do that for? You know how that full moon turns on that Black Knight. - That's only a superstitious legend. - Well, I'm not taking any chances. I'm with you. Oh, no, we lost Shaggy. I hope we find Shaggy soon. Stop that noise. I've got it! That's better. Come on. What a spooky place. Not now, Scooby. Not now. Now, look what that dog did. He knows I can't see without my glasses. There you are, Shaggy. You sound terrible. I told you to take care of that cold. Lucky I brought your medicine. I can't find that Velma nowheres. Zoinks! This will fix you up in a jiffy. Let's get out of here! See? You sound better already. Scooby-Doo! Scooby-Dooby-Doo! Sorry! Bye-bye! I tell you, the Black Knight is alive and roaming through the hallways. If we could only find a clue. It's Scooby! When Velma said, "clue," she didn't mean you, Scooby. Hey, like, wait a minute. There's a picture missing from the wall. Maybe that's a clue. - We better tell the others. - Right! It's right down here. - There's no picture missing, Shaggy. - Well, it was a minute ago. Some clue. Well, if that's blood that's a clue. It's paint. And look. A trail of it leads down the hallway. Come on, follow that paint. The trail of paint ends here at the mummy case. Come on, Shaggy. Help me open it. Don't like surprises, especially spooky ones. Oh, come on. Hey, look, a secret room. Somebody sure is a messy housekeeper. And look at that. There are two paintings exactly alike. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Right, Velma. This just about solves the mystery. - It does? - What? No time to explain now, Shaggy. We gotta get the sheriff. Let's take this back way out. Leave it to Daphne to pick the wrong door. Zoinks! Scooby, like, do something. Maybe my ventriloquism bit can get us out of this jam. If I can throw my voice to make it sound like it's coming from the room he might leave. Help! Let me out of this pot! - Help! - Help! Scooby-Doo! Zoinks! Scooby! Yikes! Scooby-Doo! We did it, Scooby-Doo. We did it. We did? Scooby-Doo! - Just as we thought! - It's the curator, Mr. Wickles. We've gotta hand it to you kids. We never would have suspected Wickles as the art swindler. Boy, it was a neat setup. He and his gang were switching fake pieces of art for the real ones in the museum. They made the fakes at night, in a secret workshop behind the mummy case. That's why they had to get rid of the professor. He was the only one who could have spotted the fakes. Oh, my gosh! Professor Hyde White! We never found him. - It's Scooby-Doo with a shoe. - Follow me! See? Professor Hyde White! All the time, it was Wickles who made that Black Knight come to life. - Then there was no legend. - Positively not. Wickles just used the story to cover up my mysterious disappearance. Somehow, he managed to get into the armor, down at the train station. And, like, on the way to the museum, he made you disappear. Zoinks! He's alive! Scooby-Doo!
Here it is, gang. Rocky Point Beach. What a groovy spot for a beach party. Yeah, man. I can already taste those chocolate-covered hot dogs. Yuck! His stomach must be made of scrap iron. Can I help it if my first toy was a garbage disposal? Come on, gang. Let's unload. All right. Okay. I'll give Daphne the boxes. Hurry up! Hey, like, where's Scooby-Doo? He's supposed to be helping me. He went surfing. Scooby-Doo! Okay! Come and get it! Oh, no! Hey, what's with Scooby-Doo? Zoinks! A seagoing ghost! Shaggy, come back! Shaggy, come out of that umbrella. No. Did you see what I saw? Yeah, we saw it and we're going back to find out what it was. Swell. I'll wait here. And when you find out, send me a telegram. We won't have to. Look! It's gone! There's something mighty spooky going on around here. Yeah, and I wonder what it is. Hey, gang, listen to this. "Another Boat Mysteriously Vanishes. Sheriff and Coast Guard are baffled by the mysterious disappearances. " "Beach hermit Ebenezer Shark claims it was the ghost of Captain Cutler who stole it. " - Ghost? - Ghost? Do you think that's what we saw last night? I don't know, but maybe that beach hermit Ebenezer Shark can give us a clue. Then let's pay him a visit tonight. Aye! I seen him with me very own eyes. A ghostly glow moving through the fog just before the boats vanish. But what makes you think it was the ghost of Captain Cutler? Because it was on a foggy night such as this that Captain Cutler's boat was wrecked. It collided with one of them fancy yachts from the marina sending Cutler down to the graveyard of ships. But before he disappeared into the sea he shouted that he would return. So by causing the yachts to vanish from the marina -  Cutler's getting his revenge. - Aye. Hey, it's Scooby! Come on! Zoinks! It's that ghost again! That's no ghost! It's just Scooby-Doo! It looks like your pooch found me old diving suit. Diving suit? Aye. Now, if you want to know any more about Cutler I think you'd better see his wife up at the old lighthouse. There's something mighty fishy about Ebenezer Shark. I'll say there is. Yeah. He looks more like a barracuda. Listen, Daph and I will stick around here and keep an eye on old Shark. You three go up to the old lighthouse and talk to Widow Cutler. - Old lighthouse? - Yeah, old lighthouse. What a creepy-looking lighthouse. Okay, Scooby. Go knock on the door. Right. Look at him. What a ham. I guess it's up to you, Velma. It's up to all of us. Now, march! Ladies first. Well, come on! Wow! Like, this place is furnished in early Halloween. It's obvious. She practices witchcraft. Hey, look at these. What zoinky labels. "Ear of a newt"? That? Oh, that's canned hyena laughs. Look. Witchcraft Made Easy. Very interesting. Velma, who do I know with long, skinny hands? Good evening. Zoinks! Mrs. Cutler, I presume? Aye. I was just tending the light and didn't hear you knock. Now, what's your problem? It's about Captain Cutler. We think we saw his ghost. You did, dearie. It was me and my witchcraft that brought Captain Cutler back from his watery grave. Then it's his ghost that's making these yachts vanish? Aye. But had I known he'd take his revenge I'd have left him under the sea. That's good! You'll pardon me doing the wash, dearie. Well, we have to go now. Thanks for your help. Anytime, dearie. Anytime. Am I glad to get out of that scary pad. Me too. Yuck! Now, our next step is to find the ghost. I think he's found us. Look! Come on! After that glow! It's in that drainpipe. Well, it got away, so let's go. Come here! Scooby will go in after it. Oh, that's different. Me? Yes, you. You're the only one that can squeeze into that drainpipe. Too fat. Too fat? Would you squeeze in for a Scooby Snack? Scooby-Doo! Like, wow! Glowing seaweed! It looks like you found a clue, Scooby-Doo. Well, Scooby-Dooby-Doo! Did you find anything? Here it is. Phosphorum pyrifora. Like, speak English. A phosphorus-glowing seaweed found only in the area known as the "graveyard of ships. " That's where Captain Cutler went down. Then maybe that's where we'll find his ghost and the answer to our mystery. But what about Ebenezer Shark? I don't know, but he headed for the marina about an hour ago. I wonder what he's up to. There it is. The graveyard of ships. I don't like it. Hey, look. A bottle. And there's a note inside. Well, what does it say? No deposit, no return. Big help. We're getting close. Keep a sharp lookout for anything suspicious. Look! One of the yachts from the marina! Hey, there's no one aboard and the motor's not running. Then, like, what's making it go? Ghost power. I was afraid you'd say that. Come on. Let's follow it. It's going into that cove, and there's no way out. Hey, something's wrong. It's gone! Vanished into thin air! It's, like, weirdo! Well, like I always say: "Onward and downward. " To the graveyard of ships, that is. We're all set. Except for Scooby. Oh, come down from there! Scooby, there's nothing to be afraid of. I'll get him down. Howdy do! Howdy do, yourself! Help! Like, wow! What a spooky place. It's a perfect home for that seagoing ghost. Well, if we're going to find any ghosts, we'd better split up. You guys go that way and we'll go this way. Okay. Look! What's that? Could that be Captain Cutler? It could be, but there's only one way to find out. Let's go. Well, is it him? No. Look at that old-fashioned diving suit. He's been down here a hundred years. The door! We're trapped! Hey, Shaggy, look. Scuba tanks. Scooby-Doo? Scooby-Doo, where are you? Hey, Shaggy? I found a clue! I found a clue! You found a clue? This cannon is loaded. There's a fuse in it. Fire! Like, no fire. I forgot matches don't light underwater. Hold still, Scooby! I am! Hey, scram! Shoo! Go! Nice going! We thought we'd never get out of this creepy cabin. Well, like, we never thought we'd lose that ghost. Then you saw him too? He's the one that locked us in. So we haven't had a chance to find any clues. I found a clue! I found a clue! You? You found a clue? Follow me. It's a secret storehouse of scuba tanks. Yeah, and all ready to use. Things are beginning to add up. You mean like two and two are five? More than that. I'd like to get a close look at that ghost. How can we? He's gone. But his trail's not. Look. Glowing footprints. Now all we gotta do is follow them. The footprints vanish right into the side of the cliff. Well, if my sense of direction is right this is the same area where that yacht from the marina vanished. Now what do we do? Like, rest. I'm pooped. Hey! I'm sinking! Look! A secret passage! You're right! Shaggy, you're a genius! - I am? - Sure. Who else but you could've sat down on the rock that opened the secret passage? I thought that rock was pretty suspicious. Come on, gang. Let's go inside. We're in a giant underground cavern! Man! Lookie there! Like, get a load of those yachts. Yeah, and they're being painted over in different colors. Hey, look at that yacht. It's the one that vanished in the cove. And look! It's tied to a minisub. It's just as we suspected and these clues prove it. Then I guess this wraps up our mystery. That is, if we can wrap up the ghost. Not wrap him up, Shaggy, suds him up. Hurry up, Fred. No telling when "glowing gruesome" will show up. I'm ready with the fire hose. Okay, everybody? I hope your contraption works. It's a cinch. We put a bar of soap in this spray container. Attach it to this fire hose turn on the water, and instant suds. And see that ramp? The ghost comes down it, we suds it up, he slips and we hose him right over into that net. Then we hoist him high as a Christmas goose. Okay, gang. Start Operation Noisemaker. Here he comes. Let him have it! Scooby! He can't see where he's going! Scooby, are you all right? Now, let's see if our mystery ghost diver is really Ebenezer Shark. - It's not him. - Then who is it? I got it! Does this seaweed help remind you of that picture on Widow Cutler's wall? Captain Cutler! Hey, listen to this, gang. "Teenage Sleuths Solve Boat Hijacking Mystery. Captain Cutler and his wife taken into custody by sheriff. " That was some plan they had. First, spreading the phony story about Cutler and then stealing the yachts from the marina. That night on the beach, Cutler was storing extra scuba tanks in the graveyard of ships. Yeah, but, like, his diving suit got covered with that kooky glowing seaweed. That's where the glowing ghost story came from. Well, that closes the mystery. How did Scooby do that? I guess that's another mystery.
You sure picked a spooky day to go boating, Freddy. It didn't start out that way. What could have happened? It's very simple. When the barometric pressure dropped and warm air came in contact with an inland cold front we ran into some unnavigable nubilation. You're right, Velma, whatever you said. - I said, we're lost in a fog. - You buzzed? No, Shaggy. Go back to sleep. Sleep, nothing. I'm fixing me a super Shaggy sandwich. Like, wow, my favorite: A double-triple-decker sardine and marshmallow-fudge sandwich. Open the mouth, between the gums. Look out, stomach. Here it comes. Well, at least you left me the olive. With him around, I can't even get a bite in edgewise. - Now what happened? - Looks like we've run aground. - Yeah, but, like, where? - Well, if I'm not mistaken it looks like we're stuck on Haunted Isle. I'm sorry I asked. The old Vasquez Castle's on this island. Maybe we can find help there. - This sure is a creepy place. - Yeah, a regular gruesome camp. Like, what's with Scooby-Doo? Hey, if you wanna play in the sand, Scooby, leave us out of it, huh? Hey, what's this? It's a torn piece of map. D- A-N-G-E-R. Danger? Hey! Look, it's, like, a message! It says, "Danger. Leave Haunted Isle. " It sure looks like someone is trying to scare us off this island. But who? And why? I don't know, but it looks like we found ourselves a mystery and maybe we'll find the answer at that castle. - Come on, let's go! - Oh, boy! Well, here it is. Old Vasquez Castle. Man, what a pad for a scare-in. The place looks deserted. That's Vasquez, the pirate. He sailed the seas in 1612. He must have used this old castle for a hideout. Come on. Let's take a look around. Man, like, plenty spooky! I once read these old castles were loaded with traps. Oh, Velma, don't be silly. That only happens in movies! - Daphne! Daphne! - What happened? Daphne fell through a trap door! Come on. We gotta find Daphne. But what about that: It was probably just the wind. That's the first wind I heard with a sense of humor. - Come on, put your nose to work. - Right. Let me out of here! Let me out of here! Wow! I wonder how I get out of this creepy inner sanctum. Well, my intuition tells me that way. Stop that whistling. You make me nervous. Like, which way did they go? - They went thattaway. - Oh, thanks, man. It's all right. - Like, wow! A talking skull. - Like, wow! I'm so scared. I wish I had a ham sandwich to calm my nerves. Well, what do you know, a ham sandwich! Wouldn't you know, it needs some mustard. This has gotta be my imagination. Otherwise, I'd be scared. Now, maybe my imagination can, like, cut it in half. Someone's coming. Shaggy! Hi, Daphne. Hey, look. Shaggy found Daphne. For once, he used his head. - Are you all right? - Yeah. Just as soon as I have six or seven sandwiches. He's all right, all right. There goes that crazy wind again. Crazy wind, nothing. Look! I warn you. Leave Haunted Isle and never return. The phantom has spoken. Grab that phantom! Did you see that? Yeah! Like, he went through the wall, nonstop. - There's a logical explanation for this. - Quick, tell me. - The place is haunted. - Thanks a lot. Why don't we take that phantom man's advice and clear out of this place? No, Shag. We're not going. - Like, why not? - Three good reasons, Shaggy. First, no phantom's gonna scare us away. Second, why does he want us off this island so bad? - And third, we're marooned. - I'll buy that last one. Hey, fellas, over here. A clue. I found a key in this chest. It must belong to the phantom. Hey, there's some writing on it. It says, "Second passage of the old bell. " - Second passage? - Old bell? There's no old bell in this castle. I've got it. "Passage" must mean a passage in a book. Then The Old Bell must be the name of a book! That's right. And the best place to find a book is in the library. Right. Come on! This is the book called The Old Bell. Look, in the second passage, the word "catacombs" is underlined in red. If my knowledge is correct, we should find catacombs in the basement. This is the place. Okay, Scooby. Go in and take a look around. We'll keep watch out here. No, I'm not kidding. There he goes with his fake-wounded routine. What a ham. Would you do it for a Scooby Snack? How about two? - Three? - Okay, three. Scooby says it's okay. Man, look at all that crazy magic stuff. A saw-them-in-two box, disappearing cabinets, levitating tables. Gosh! But what's all this magic stuff doing here? I think I'm beginning to figure it out. Somebody's coming! Quick! Into the closet! Hurry! Whoever it was must've gone away. Look! The phantom! I warned you to leave the island! Now you will pay! I'll pay! I'll pay! How about 4 bits? Not that kind of pay. Let's get out of here! Help! Help! - Shaggy! - Help! Shaggy! Hey, this is just a dummy head! Someone mention me? - Hey, look! - A magic carpet! I hope this trick works. Ali, go oop. Wait for me! - Well, we've lost him. - Groovy. - Now we gotta catch him. - Not groovy. If we're ever gonna solve this mystery - But how? - Simple, and with just a few things. That suit of armor and crossbow that cannonball and old spring I gotta hand it to you, Fred. You really know how to build a better mousetrap. In this case, a better phantom trap. But what good is it? We can't catch a phantom. I have a hunch that we can, right, Velma? Check, but first we'll have to find him and lure him here. - But how do we find the phantom? - We don't. Scooby does. Scooby does? Right. With your super-sleuth nose, you'll be able to sniff him out. Well, look at him. My nose. Cold in my nose. Cut it out. You don't have a cold in your nose. How do we know the phantom will chase Scooby-Doo? - He's a dog. - Don't worry. We'll soon fix that. Come on, Scooby. Be brave. Just think of Rin Din Din. Lassie. John Wayne. John Wayne? - John Wayne? - Sure, Scooby. Scooby-Doo! Like I said before, what a ham. Phantom! Phantom! Not here. You cannot escape me. Get ready! Here they come! Jump, Scooby! Oh, no! Scooby tripped into our trap. Now you will not escape me. - We caught the phantom! - Thanks to Scooby-Doo! When the fog lifted, we spotted your beached boat and decided to investigate. - But who is that? - This? This is the end of the mystery. Well, if it isn't our old friend Bluestone the Great -  an ex-magician wanted in six states. - But what is he doing here? He must have heard the legend of the Vasquez treasure. Everybody's after it. I get it. He used his magic tricks to keep people away from the island -  while he searched for it. - When he saw us -  he tried to scare us away. - Well, his scaring days are over. He's going to do a final disappearing act courtesy of the local jail. There's one more thing. We figured out all those floating tricks. - Look, no hands! - See? Wires. But how did you walk right through a solid wall? One of my best acts. Let me give one last performance. Hold this rope. It was merely an illusion done with trick mirrors and a special projector. I could cast my image anywhere I wanted and by stepping away from the mirror, it appears that I walk through walls. I must admit, Mr. Bluestone you're a good magician, but a bad phantom. Man, I wonder if, like, there really is a treasure. That's Scooby barking. Come on! - Look! Scooby found something. - Maybe it's the treasure. Well, Scooby-dee-Doo.
Are you sure we took the right turn, Shaggy? Sure. We took this road and turned to the right. No wonder we're lost. You've been reading the map upside down. Here's where we are. At Gold City, the old ghost town. - Ghost town? - Ghost town? What will we do now? What's that over there? "Gold City Guest Ranch. Vacancy. " Maybe we can spend the night there. - There? - Yes, there. Go ahead. Ring the bell, Shaggy. Ring-a-ding-ding, coming up. Welcome, kids. Come on in. I'm Big Ben, owner of this guest ranch. Do you happen to have any rooms? Do I? You're my only guests. Come on in and register and I'll call old Hank. Hank. Oh, Hank. We have some guests. Hey, Scooby, come here. Now, this is Hank, the caretaker here at the ranch. Pleased to meet you. Hank, show the guests to their rooms, like a good feller. Follow me. That will be the girls' room and you fellers can bunk in this one, just across the hall. These sure are nice rooms. I can't understand why the place is empty. It's the miner. - The miner? - The who? The Miner Forty-Niner. - Forty-Niner? - Yes siree. He came to Gold City in 1849 and he can't rest until he finds the last vein of gold. Like, wow, that's what I call an ancient miner. That's for sure. And at night, you can hear the mine moaning calling for the miner. But what has he got to do with the ranch? I don't know but lately, he's been coming up here and scaring the guests away. And I'm going away in the morning myself. Man, that's the wildest tale I ever heard. Ridiculous. A 100-year-old miner. Still, something must have scared off the guests. Gone! Well, it's still early. Why don't we go into the ghost town and take a look around? Wonder what it's like on a Saturday night. Boy, what a spooky old street. I've seen enough. Let's go back. Not until we walk around this ghost town and see what we can find. Like, I know what we'll find. - What? - Ghosts. Hey, look, Shaggy. A real old-time Western saloon. When you said old, you just weren't, like, kidding. - Sarsaparilla, bartender. - Two. No wonder this place is empty. You ask for a sarsaparilla, and all you get is a glass of spider webs. Spider webs? - Zoinks, ghosts! - Ghosts? It's not a ghost. It's a player piano. So who's playing it? It's automatic. It must've turned itself on automatically. Now, come down out of those draperies. Like, why couldn't you have been a poodle? Did you find any clues? - Not a one. - Neither did I. Let's take a look in this old hotel. Maybe our mysterious miner rented a room for the night. - Oh, go on in, Scooby. - Yikes! What a creaky, creepy place. Hey, Scooby, come on. Oh, wait for me. It's lucky for you the room's empty. Let's get back to the others. He's got me! Help! It's only a tree branch. I knew it all the time. The only place we haven't looked is the old mine. And that's all boarded up. I'm beginning to think there really isn't an ancient miner. Well, let's keep moving. Keep together, now. Zoinks! The miner's chasing Scooby! Some miner. It's only a cigar-store Indian. Oh, Scooby. Quit clowning. Who's clowning? Look. It's hollow. Hey, what's this inside? It looks like a map of Gold City. And look how new it is. What's a new map like that doing in an old Indian like this? It's quite simple. - Somebody was hiding it. - Maybe these numbers mean something. Left 10, right 7, left 4, right 23. Maybe it's directions to a buried treasure. Yeah. Like a fortune in buried chocolate cheeseburgers. But those directions don't make sense. - Then they must mean something. - But what? I've got it. I bet it's the combination of a safe. And there's an old safe in the lobby of this hotel. Shaggy, you work on the combination as I read off the numbers. Okay, but I need a moment to warm up. Now, I must have absolute quiet while I work. - Oh, Shaggy. Shaggy. - Quiet. Look, I have the combination. Just turn the knob to the right. Well, why didn't you say so? It's open. Stop showing off, Scooby. I knew it was open all the time. - Like, wow. Get a load of that. - A secret elevator. Well, let's see where it goes. All aboard. Come on, Scooby. Come on, Scooby. You're not chicken. Would you come with us for a Scooby snack? - Two? - Okay. Two it is. Well, come on. Scooby-Doo. Down. Wow. Look where we've landed. A mine tunnel. It must be the old Gold City Mine. Well, if there is a miner, this is where we'll find him. Come on. It's sure dark in here. We could use some light. Hey, I found some candles. Shaggy, that's dynamite! Dynamite? That's strange. This end of the mine's lit by lanterns. Yeah, and I wonder who lit them. Zoinks. You had to ask. That must be the moan that Hank was talking about. I think we better split up and try and find where that moan came from. I'll go with Daphne and Velma. - You go with Scooby-Doo. - Thanks a lot. And, Shaggy, if you find anything, holler. I'm liable to holler even if I don't find anything. Yipe! What are you trying to do, Scooby? Well, quit the clowning and come on. Look at all these doors. Look in one of those, I'll look in this one. Right. You gotta be kidding. I suppose you want me to look. Yep, yep, yep, yep. That's what I was afraid of. - It's empty. - Huh? Empty? What are you trying to do, scare me again? What now? Boy, what a scaredy-dog. You still think there's something in that closet? Okay. We'll switch. You look in this door, and I'll look in that one. And there better be something in it. Oh, no! Zoinks! It's the Miner Forty-Niner! This must be a storeroom. Careful. Those old floors look weak. I know. I know. Look out! Are you all right? Say something. I'm all right, just covered with flour. You wait up there. I'll be right up. We gotta, like, find a place to hide. Quick, in here. Zoinks! A ghost. Let's get out of here. We finally got away from that goony miner. It's him! Look out! Are you guys all right? Groovy. Hey, what happened to Daphne? I fell down in here. Wouldn't you know it? Danger-prone Daphne fell into a mineshaft. - I'll get her. - You'll get her? It's the Miner Forty-Niner. Hey, gang. There's a maze of secret passages down there. And guess what I saw in that mine. Yeah. We saw him too. I guess Hank wasn't kidding about that ancient miner. Do you suppose that's the miner moaning? Well, like, if I had a face like that, I'd moan too. Hey, look. I found a clue. It seems that this wire leads up to that speaker. Now things are beginning to make a little sense. And I have a hunch what we'll find at the other end of this wire. I was right. A tape recorder. Well, that accounts for the mysterious moaning. Hey, look what I found. Like, jars of chocolate syrup. Chocolate syrup, nothing. That's samples of crude oil. Oil? In a gold mine? Hey, this mystery is really getting mysterious. And what about our mysterious miner? I've got a hunch he'll show up soon. Let's borrow this microphone. And, Shaggy, we'll need you too. Listen to that Shaggy go. And Scooby's great at being a train. Got him. Oh, no. Scooby can't stop. Scooby went right through the shack. - He's caught him. - I hope. Hey, that's gotta be the miner. But where's Scooby? Help! Look, stilts. Shaggy's right. He is wearing stilts. Then this can only be one person. - Hank. - Hank? Oh, dagnabit. So it was old Hank who was scaring off my guests. To force you out of business. That way, he could buy the guest ranch, the ghost town- And, like, the mine for almost nothing. Then there must still be gold in that old mine. Not gold. Black gold. - You mean oil? - Like, right. But how did Hank know about the oil? He accidentally found the secret mine entrance in the old hotel safe. And instead of gold, he found oil. He had the exact location laid out on a map. Then he, like, hid the map in the cigar-store Indian for safekeeping. Too bad. We could have been partners. Now, instead of being rich, he's in jail. Hey, like, what happened to Scooby? There he is. Scooby, look out for that gopher hole. Scooby-Doo! One of those apples better be for me.
Oh, boy! Hello. Help! Help! Stop! Stop! Come back here! Help! My princess has been dognapped! Dognapped? - That sounds like Scooby-Doo. - He's sure in a hurry. Scooby-Doo, what's with you? Here's a bulletin just in. Flash! The dognappers have struck again. The third prize dog kidnapped in the last three days. Wow! Like, a canine crime wave! Here's another bulletin. Buck Masters, the owner of the first dog stolen has just offered a $500 reward. Gang, we've just been handed our next mystery. - And, we'll begin with Mr. Buck Masters. - Yeah, yeah, yeah! That's right. I've decided not to pay the ransom. I'd rather use the money to catch those crooks. I was sure to win first prize at the county dog show this year. Now Bob Miller's Great Dane is a shoo-in. - Great Dane? - Did you say Great Dane? Yes. Bob's been grooming his dog for this show all year. But if that's the case, isn't the Great Dane in danger? - He could be dognapped. - Don't worry. I warned Bob. And he only takes the dog out for exercise at night and then only on Beach Boulevard near the police station. It seems safe enough there. From now on, all dog owners must be on their guard. Mr. Masters, we're gonna find out who's stealing those dogs and why. Yep. Dognappers, beware. Frankly, I don't see what you kids can do. I don't have a lead to give you. That's all right, Mr. Masters. We have a plan. We do? See this picture of the champion? This will help a lot. Come on, Freddy. Tell us, like, what's the plan? - Yeah. - Simple. We'll give the dognappers a decoy. And then when they grab the decoy, we'll trail them to their hideout. - But what if we lose the dognappers? - Not a chance. We'll plant this tiny transmitter in the decoy's collar. Our direction finder will do the rest. Yeah, but who's the decoy? Scooby-Doo? Scooby's got a point there. Who'd dognap Scooby for ransom? We'll fix that, and Scooby will be brave. Won't you, Scooby? Now, here's a Scooby snack for courage. Shaggy, why'd you do that? Because I know who's stuck with the job of taking the decoy on a leash. Not bad. Not bad at all. Now here's a snack for you, Scooby. Okay, the decoys are fed. Now let's get down to work. What are we doing, solving mysteries or running a beauty parlor for pooches? Hold it, Scooby. Wait till I get your new collar on. Now, how do you like that? Well, Bob Miller said we could take his place tonight, Scooby. - So come on, champ, let's walk. - Scooby-Doo! Hey, take it easy. Slow down! Come on, Scooby. You're a decoy, remember? Keep your mind on your work. Sorry. Now, cut that out. Keep going. Keep going. Boy! At least you don't have to take another bath. Lucky for you, I'm a dog lover. Wow! Look at that truck smoke! No! No! No! Scooby! They got him! Help! Help! Help! I'm coming, Scooby! I'm coming! I'll never catch him this way. Charlie! Charlie! You got any wheels I can borrow? This is an emergency! Just my motor scooter. Thanks, man! Well, this is Beach Boulevard. But no sign of Shaggy and Scooby. That transmitter on Scooby's collar is moving awfully fast. The dognappers must have Scooby. Okay, this is it. Here we go! Help! Help! Oh, no! Man! It's Geronimo! - I got him, boss. - So you got Miller's Great Dane. Good work, Mike. Let's have a look. You fool! That's not Bob Miller's champion Great Dane! How could you mistake this mutt for a show dog? Gee, boss. He was right where you said he'd be. Get this phony decoy out of here! But what will I do with him? Give him a ride down the mountain on the old handcar. By the time it stops, he'll be 20 miles away. - Come on. Back in the crate. - No! No! And when this weirdo Indian attacked I felt like a late-show rerun of Custer's last stand. Are you sure it was a real Indian? Real? Why, when he waved that tomahawk, even my hair was scared. Well, no hoof prints in the road, but here's something I found. It's an authentic Indian relic, at least 1000 years old. I told you I thought he looked kind of ghostly. Hold it, gang. The transmitter on Scooby's collar is moving again. And it looks like it's heading for Indian Gap. Let's plot an intercept course. Oh, no! Poor Scooby! As a decoy, you're a dud. Well, so long, pooch. Enjoy the ride. Hey! That was Scooby! Hey, Scooby-Doo! Hang on, Scooby! We'll save you! Hurry, Freddy! Give her the gas! One for the money, two for the show three to get ready, and here I go! We're on a trestle. Boy, was that close! As soon as we slow down, Scooby, I'll get you out of that crate. What's that? Sounds like the midnight express. It is! I hope this is the brake! It's rusty. It's not holding. I'll help! I'll help! Watch it! - Faster! Faster! - I'm going faster! - Here they come! - That train is awfully close! There was a switch by the crossroad. Come on! Let's go! Scooby, you're a brave decoy. Did those old dognappers hurt you, Scooby? This is all very nice, but it doesn't solve the mystery. Scooby, can you tell us where the dognappers took you? Yeah! Yeah! Oh, no! Not the Indian! Not the ghost of Geronimo! Yeah! Yeah! Geronimo! Well, we've only got one lead. And that's to backtrack to that old railroad spur. Everybody game? We can get along without the sound effect, thank you. - Geronimo! - Geronimo! Stop the car! Stop the car! Head for the rocks. - He's gone. - Let's get back to the handcar. This is real, like in the movies. I told you that Indian was for real. Well, this arrow isn't for real. It's factory-made. Then how about that? Is that for real? Looks deserted, but somebody's up there. - Nobody's getting my beautiful hair. - Me either. Gang, we've got to get up to that Indian village. And I think I know how we can do it. Now, we're all ready. This giant slingshot will shoot the arrow up to the village taking the rope with it. Then everybody climbs up, okay? Okay, it's solid. Now, let's get up to that village. - Not me. - Scooby, you come back here. Man, this is spooksville. - Like, Indian-style. - Yeah. Spooksville. Okay, gang. Let's explore. - What's that? - Look! Up there! Leave this place, paleface intruders or suffer fate of Spanish conquistadores buried in desert below! That's him! That's him! Remember my warning and go! That Indian sure spoke good English considering he's supposed to be - Maybe he went to night school. - Okay, everybody. We'll head for the dome-shaped building. - Hey, where's Scooby? - He'll catch up to us. Let's move on. Wait for me! - Hey! Come on! Get away from me! - Get out of here! Leave me alone! Go away! If I ever get out of this, we'll call this dance the Batusi. My glasses! - Get out of here, bats! - My glasses! I can't see without them! - I'm getting out of here. - But I've just got to find my glasses! - Hi, Shaggy. - Hi, Scooby. Boy, I sure am glad to get away from those bats. - It's Geronimo! - Geronimo! - Shaggy? - Yipes! It's you, Scooby. Hey, what are you doing with Velma's glasses? Come on. The coast is clear. Where is everybody? Why, Shaggy, you're petrified with fear. And you too, Scooby. Help me find my glasses. Here they are, Velma. - Where did you find them? - It's a long story, Velma. Long story. This looks like their ceremonial building where they held their special rites. - Perfect place for a witch doctor to live. - Yeah. Come on. Let's find him. Hey, look! I doubt if that fire's been burning 1000 years. Freddy, this place gives me goose bumps. You have violated the sacred temple. If you do not leave this village now you will remain here forever. - Okay, we found him. Now let's go. - Not yet. - I want to check that altar. - You check it. - I'll wait right here. - Okay, I'll just be a moment. Daphne? She's gone! Daphne! Daphne! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food? Good boy. Where is it? Lead me to it. What's it smell like, Indian corn? Beef jerky? I'll try anything. Man! Those Pueblo Indians sure knew how to live. We have salami, ham, canned sardines, pudding, not to men- Hey, wait a minute. - This isn't Indian food. - Dog food. - Scooby food. - Scooby food? - Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! - It is dog food. Scooby, we found the dognappers' hideout. But I don't see any dognappers around. So why not fortify ourselves with a groovy little snack? And the ham slice connected to the rye bread. Lettuce connected to the boiled egg. Mustard slapped on a salami slice. And the cheese connected to the deviled ham. Hey, what's this? Scooby-Doo, where are you? Scooby, untie me, quick! That witch doctor may come back at any time. - And the dogs? - The dogs? Oh, sure. We'll free the dogs. Now, hurry! I got a hunch there's a secret passage around here someplace. There it is! - Velma! What are you doing there? - I don't know. I sat down to rest, the next minute I'm here. Freddy! Velma! Quick! This way! Good boy, Scooby! You found them and freed them all! Does this mean we've solved the dognapping mystery? Not yet. Hey, Scooby, see if any of your pals know anything about that witch doctor or the dognapper. Okay. - You know where he is, Scooby? - Yeah! Yeah! Okay, let's go. We're right behind you. While I'm searching for Scooby, I'll just finish this little morsel. Yipe! What a close shave! That was almost a catastrophe. Hey, Shaggy! Come on! Follow the dogs! Come on, Shaggy! Scooby-Doo! They've spotted him! The dogs have him! Why, it's Buck Masters, the owner of Big Red. - He's the dognapper! - You blasted kids! Why didn't you mind your own business? Catching dognappers is our business, Mr. Masters. After all, Scooby-Doo is a dog. And we love him very much. That was quite a plot you kids uncovered. Who would have suspected Masters of dognapping his own pet? He decided to win the dog show by dognapping the only three dogs who could beat Big Red. Then Big Red was to turn up just before the show and win first prize. You said something about a phantom Indian on horseback. - What about that? - Simple. He used a movie projector from the back of his truck. Look! Geronimo! He's back again! Scooby-Doo!
Come. Come. Come. Come. Well, we're almost to the Wetherby estate, gang. It sure is nice of Sharon to ask us up here for the weekend. There's so many groovy things to do. Yeah, like swimming and eating, and tennis and eating, and riding and eating and eating and- How do you like that? Hey, look up there. Jeepers, someone's going into that old mansion. Like, wow. Who'd do a kooky thing like that? I don't know. Gee, it's sure good to see all of you. But I hope this wasn't the wrong weekend for you to come. - Why's that, Sharon? - Well, the last few nights we've been hearing a lot of strange noises. And now it looks like my Uncle Stuart has vanished. Could it have been him we saw going into that old mansion? You mean the Kingston mansion? Maybe we'd better go up there and see. Uncle Stuart? Uncle Stuart? Like, you know, there's no sign of him anywhere. Look, someone's in the shadows. Uncle Stuart. He's become an old man. What happened, Stuart? It started when a ghostly voice called out from the old mansion. I had to obey it. It drew me out of the house. I was in a trance. I went past the Kingston mausoleum and finally into the old mansion. And there is where I saw the ghost of Elias Kingston. The Wetherby fortune belongs to me. Unless it is returned to this mansion before morning the entire family shall suffer this terrible fate. That's when he made me an old man, as a warning to you all. What are we going to do? First of all, I'm going to call the sheriff. That's strange. The phone's dead. Why don't you go get the sheriff, Mr. Wetherby. We'll wait here. We'll keep an eye on Stuart until you get back. - You sure you'll be all right? - Sure. And just to make sure nothing else happens we'll all take turns standing guard. Who's gonna stand the first watch? Who else? The watchdog. Right. The watchdog. - That's me? - That's right. That's you. Just think, Scooby, no ghostly voice will get past your keen sense of hearing. That old hard-of-hearing trick isn't gonna work tonight, Scooby. Come. Come. Where'd he go? Hey, what's with the bugle call, Scooby? It looks like Uncle Stuart's gone again. He's not the only one. Sharon's gone too. - But, like, where? - We'd better get up to that old mansion. And fast. I don't see any sign of Sharon, Uncle Stuart or the ghost. Like, maybe we're in luck and he's out haunting another house. Say, what have you got on your feet, roller skates? - Why are you wearing those things? - I'm not taking any chances. If we do see that ghost, he'll never catch me. Come on, let's keep looking. I wonder if ghosts can hide in little pots. I guess not. Scooby-Doo! Oh, boy, oh, boy. How soggy can a guy get? If there's one thing I can't stand, it's taking a bath in a haunted house. Whether you know it or not, Scooby, you found our first clue. I did? Sure. Who ever heard of a ghost needing a watchdog to scare anybody away? Like, you mean there isn't any ghosts? Well, I haven't seen any. Yet. And we haven't seen Sharon or her uncle either. Hey, was Uncle Stuart wearing a blue suit, red tie and tennis shoes? Yeah, when we last saw him. Then I think we found him. Only he looks a little older now. I guess that ghost wasn't kidding. That's just about as old as you can get. It sure would help if we could find another clue. I found one. - Groovy. What is it? - Him. It's the ghost! Ghost? This is the last warning. Either the fortune is here by morning or all those in the Wetherby house shall grow old. Now go. Old Horrible really said a frightful mouthful. - But we're not gonna let that scare us. - We're not? No, Shaggy. We're gonna solve this mystery. Hey, where's Scooby? I bet he's in that closet. "Out to lunch. " Can you imagine? Yeah, with Scooby, I wouldn't be surprised. How do you like that? He didn't even invite me. Hey, that was the ghost. Yeah, he went into the mausoleum. Come on, let's see what he's up to. Okay, Shaggy. Use Velma's fingerprinting kit and dust for prints. Right, Freddy. I'll give it the old Sherlock Holmes touch. Like, wow. Look at all them fingerprints. Not my hand, silly. That door. Freddy, we got something. Just as I thought. Fingerprints. Wait a minute. Ghosts wouldn't leave fingerprints. - Like, maybe he can turn into a bat. - Don't be silly. Okay, Scooby, go in there and sniff around for that ghost. Would you do it for a Scooby Snack? I'll give you one. How about two? Three. Four? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll go. Scooby-Dooby-Doo! Like, there's times I'll do anything for a Scooby Snack. It's okay. Come on in. - There's no ghost in here. - Well, we know he came in. There's something on that table. This might be a clue. A book on crystalomacy. Crystal O'Macy? I used to know a Crystal Nerdlinger. It's not a girl, silly. It's a book about how to use a crystal ball. - You mean the kind a fortuneteller uses? - Right. Say, there's an old swami place in town. Maybe there's some kind of a connection. Zoinks, the door! Hey, we're locked in. Well, let's hope there's a secret way out of here. Start tapping on the walls. Hey. Like, what happened to Scooby? He was right there a second ago. It's a secret passage. You did it, Scooby. You found the way out. I did? Well, Scooby-Dooby-Doo! That secret passage was a shortcut to the Wetherby estate. I wonder if it has to do with Sharon's disappearance. I don't know. But maybe we'll find the answer here at the swami's place. It looks like the swami's out swami-ing somewhere else. I guess he won't mind if we take a look around. I wonder what's in here. Daphne, not the storage closet. Well, Daphne, you did it again. Like, someone's coming. Yoo-hoo. Swami. Oh, Swami. Oh, there you are. - Oh, no. A customer. - And she thinks Scooby's the swami. Shaggy, you better throw your voice and make Scooby sound like a swami. - Yeah, I better. - Mr. Swami, I have something to ask you. Good evening. Please be seated. Oh, swami, tell me, what do you see in the crystal ball? - My reflection. - Your reflection? My word. No, wait. I see a tall, handsome man in your future. And you're dancing together cheek to cheek. Now he's whispering something to you. - He is? What is the dear boy saying? - "Get off my foot. " Enough of this. I want my palm read. Yes, ma'am. You did say "red. " How dare you! How about that? All that advice and she didn't even pay us a dime. I hope that's the end of the customers for a while. Okay, gang. Let's get on with our investigation. Hey, look. The table's floating. Zoinks! It's the gooney ghost! You did not do as I said. Now you shall pay. Hey, look out! Duck! It's after us! Here it comes again. I've heard of flying saucers, but this is silly. Run. Run. Run. We got rid of it. We did? Then, like, what's that? - He's a real joker. - I'm not laughing. Duck! Look out, Scooby! Scooby caught the table. Man, this flew like it was jet-propelled. You mean like fan-propelled. See? A fan-type motor underneath gave it the power. Are you okay, Scooby? I'm okay. Hey, look, suitcases. Maybe somebody just moved in. Then let's move out. And look what I found: A professional makeup kit. And what's that? It looks like a TV camera. You're right, Shaggy. Yeah. It's a miniature TV camera. Hey, smile, Scooby. That's how the ghost got on the crystal ball: Closed-circuit TV. See, Scooby? That's how you look on TV. What a ham. Well, we got a lot of clues. - We do? - She's right. Enough clues to turn the tables on that ghost. Now, here's what we're gonna do. Yoo-hoo, Mr. Ghost! I'm here with the fortune. Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo! Good. You brought the fortune. How fortunate for you. Stay until I see with my own eyes. It's a trick. I'll turn you to bones! The plan's working, Scooby. - You can't get away! - Quick, get behind the curtain. Scooby, I hope the ghost doesn't find us. Perfecto. I got my shoes, now let's join the gang. I can hear the ghost coming. Get ready for phase two. - All set, Shaggy? - Yeah. Let's go. - He's in the hall. - Turn on the projector. Stop, or I'll mummify you! Wait. Hold it. This place is really haunted. Now watch what he does when he sees the tape of you, Scooby. Oh, no! That does it. It's working, Sharon. He's going into the secret room, where he had me tied up. Well, Miss Sharon, I still have you, and the fortune shall yet be mine- How did that get here? Let me out of here. Here he comes. Golly, he's running like a ghost was after him. - Now. Throw it! - Bombs away! I guess that about wraps up the ghost story. Scooby-Dooby-Doo! Mr. Wetherby, this ghost really doesn't need any introduction. As soon as we clean him up I'm sure you'll recognize him. There. Look familiar? - Uncle Stuart. - Like, in person. He thought he could scare you into giving up the family fortune. That ghostly wailing was only a recording. And by a clever use of makeup, he made himself look old. When I came downstairs to investigate a noise, I saw Uncle Stuart's wig blow off. - I knew he wasn't old. - So he had to take you prisoner. But where does the swami come in? What better way for a swindler to disappear? Uncle Stuart, why did you do it? Well, I guess he can explain it to the sheriff when he gets here. - I bet you kids are starving. - Groovy. Zoinks, that's for me. Hey, what's this? "Scooby-Doo was here. " The whole turkey? Gone? Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
Gee, this is wonderful, Uncle John. The Ape Man Of Forbidden Mountain. What a groovy title for a picture. It sure was swell of you to give us jobs as extras. Kids, I'm the grateful one. I need you because the local people won't work in this film. - Why is that, Mr. Maxwell? - The local people are very superstitious. They believe an old legend about a real Ape Man. They say he's the one that burned down the old mansion years ago. - How do I look? - How do you look? I don't see any difference. We've had three reports that the Ape Man has been seen up here at night. They've seen a real Ape Man? Real Ape Man? I just remembered a dental appointment back in town. - Me too. - Stop it, you two. It's only a superstition. Right, Uncle John? Right. The only Ape Man on this mountain is my stuntman Carl. Any time you're ready, J.J. All right, Miss Mint, you just run out on the rope bridge. Okay? Right, Mr. Maxwell. That's our star, Candy Mint. And you'll see Carl in the Ape Man suit. Okay, roll them! Man, he could be for real. What a beast. Yeah, beast. Great. He's even better than he was in rehearsal. Now, watch Candy on the bridge. Watch the Ape Man jump up and down on the bridge and try to spill Candy. No, Carl! Stop it! That's not in the script! Help! I don't think he heard you. He heard me, but that ape is not my stuntman. Somebody, make him stop! Scooby-Doo! Help! Help! Scooby, steady the bridge! - She made it! - And Scooby did it! - Good show, Scooby. - You sure sent that thing packing. You were so brave. Scooby-Dooby-Doo. - That was a daring rescue, Scooby. - He was better than Laddie. - What do we do now, Mr. Maxwell? - Find my missing stuntman, Carl. - This is his trailer. - Maybe we can pick up a clue to where Carl might be. I'm worried. I didn't put much stock in that Ape Man legend until now. Hey, Scooby, is that you acting scared? Ape Man's head. Ape Man's head? Oh, that's just part of a costume. Hey, that's a good trick. - How'd you do it? - I don't know. Then there must be somebody in the trunk. - Come on, Scooby, open it. - Not me. - Yes, you. - Now, Scooby don't go into one of your acts. Just open the trunk. Okay. - It's a man! - It's a man? It must be Carl, the stuntman. - What happened? - I came in to dress and a big, hairy animal grabbed me and threw me in the trunk. - Was it the Ape Man? - Ape Man? What's going on? An Ape Man of some kind sabotaged our shooting and almost hurt Candy. The old legend, huh? It must have been him that got me. Oh, Mr. Maxwell, I'm sorry, but I quit until that beast is caught. I'm with her. Mr. Maxwell, I'm quitting too. Can't you wait a few days? I'll get this mystery cleared up. I'm afraid I'll have to withdraw my job offer. It's just too dangerous right now. - Yeah! - Maybe we can give you a hand in solving this mystery. - Well - We can stand guard. Yeah, who's afraid of a big, bad ape? I am. Okay, gang, Daphne's uncle let us stay on the condition we be careful. According to the legend the Ape Man lives in a secret cave somewhere in the rocks. It's strange how he was smart enough -  to get rid of that stuntman. - There's something fishy about that. A dumb Ape Man is bad enough. One that smart I can live without. - Get it? Live without. - Me too. Did you know that this set is built on the ruins of the original old mansion? There should be some good clue-hunting around here. Well, what are we waiting for? Let's search. Scooby-Doo! Keep a sharp lookout for anything that will give us a clue. Hey, Scooby, what's that you found? Somebody left half a hamburger. - Hunting clues always makes me hungry. - Wait! - That's a clue. - Don't eat that clue, Shaggy. - Clue? - Yeah, clue. See those claw marks? The Ape Man was eating this sandwich. - That's odd. Apes don't eat meat. - Maybe this Ape Man is more than an ape. - It's okay, Shaggy. You can eat it. - What? Me eat after an ape? I can't do it. I'll do it. Okay, let's split up and search for this Ape Man who eats hamburgers. And remember, this set was built to make a scary movie. So watch out for trap doors. Trap doors? Hidden bedrooms? - It's kind of spooky in here. - Oh, don't be a scaredy-cat. Stick them up. What's the password? - Shaggy, are you trying to be funny? - No, but somebody else is trying. Stick them up. What's the password? Stick them up. What's the password? The great ape is first-rate. Wait a minute. That sounds like a parrot. Stick them up. What's the password? Scooby-Doo! That's what I call fowl play. Get it? It's the Ape Man! Look out! Help! He got me! Can't we talk this over man to Ape Man? Shaggy, that ape is stuffed. Stuffed ape? Well, I hope you don't think it had me fooled for a minute. I knew it all the time. Oh, brother. There isn't anything in here but old books. Here's something. A copy of the film's shooting script. Next you'll say the Ape Man was here reading it. It was left open to the scene they were shooting today. Maybe there's a clue up here on these shelves. Hey, did you know that in the film, people mysteriously vanished from this room? Hey, where did Freddy go? He's vanished! - What's with Scooby-Doo? - Something about the mirror. Watch. - Something phony. - Something phony? See? Zoinks! Cut out! It's the Ape Man! It's locked. - Scooby, do something. - Yeah. Talk to him, dog to beast. - Whatever you said, Scooby, it's working. - He's retreating. After him. It's dark at the top of the stairs. He'll get away. Turn on some lights, Daphne. Oh, dear. Which is the right switch? Wrong switch, Daphne. Scooby-Doo! Why didn't you put on the brakes, Scooby? I like to slide. He likes to slide. Oh, boy. That puts the stairs back, but I wonder what the other switches do. Well, with your luck, Daph the next button you push will bring the roof down, but go ahead. I'll try this one. - Hi, gang. - It's Freddy! - Boy, the Ape Man almost got us. - But Scooby scared him away. Well, I found the perfect trap for the Ape Man. Come on. Now, this is the basement where the last scenes of the movie are to be shot. Look up there on the ceiling. That net was put up to capture the Ape Man in the film. And we can use it to capture the real Ape Man. - Yeah, yeah, yeah! - Great. How do you know it will work? I've tested it. See that pulley? The net's connected to the rope, the rope runs down to the reel and the reel is wired to that dark switch box, which you'll pull to release the net. And look, under the net there's an X on the floor where the Ape Man should be when the net falls. But how are we gonna get him to stand there? Simple, Daphne. When the Ape Man reaches the X we will put the spotlight on him and blind him for a second while Velma pulls the switch. Yeah, but how are you gonna get the Ape Man down in the basement? - Hey, don't look at me. - Don't look at me. Scooby, will you do it for a few Scooby Snacks? You get a bonus snack after you get the Ape Man down here. - Okay? - Okay. Scooby Snacks won't work on me this time. Would you do it for a Shaggy Snack? A little something I whipped up. - A Shaggy Snack? - Yes. It's a potpie with pizza crust anchovies, pepperoni, cherries and all in a thick chocolate sauce. - I'll do it. I'll do it. - Let's go. Scooby-Doo! - What's that noise? - I don't know. It came from this room. Wow, look at those trophies. A deer, a rhino, a lion and a Ape Man? Ape Man? Don't be silly. That's only a trophy. Come on, let's play a game, Scooby. Some trophies. One, two, three, four. - Hey, Shaggy. - Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Watch this shot. One, two, three Eight ball in the corner pocket. Sorry, Scooby. One, two, three Let's see, Scooby's over there. Then who is-? Let's go! Here they come. Ready, Velma? All set, Freddy. No, Scooby, not here. Hey, you're steaming up my glasses. Get ready to spring the trap! Now, Velma! I can't see. I hope this is it. Pull the other switch, Velma! Quick, spring the trap! I'm trying. That's it. Now get the lights back on. Hey, we got him. Come on, gang. Yeah, you got him. King Kong in the flesh. King Kong. It's a cinch that Ape Man is still in the basement. - He didn't have time to go back upstairs. - Hey, gang. Looks like Scooby found a clue. - What is it? - Scooby's pointing to a tuft of hair -  caught in this cask. - Let's have a look. So the Ape Man ran by here. What does it prove? - Maybe it's not a wine cask. - Okay, if it's not, what do you think it is? Offhand, I'd call it a door. It's a tunnel that goes back into the mountain. So this is the way he escaped. He won't get away this time. The film company didn't build this tunnel. No, this is more like the cave where the Ape Man is supposed to live. - If you believe the old legend. - I believe it. Where are we? Wow, the dressing rooms for the movie people. And we'd better search them. Come on. We'll split up here. Shaggy, you and Scooby take this one. Now, play it cool. Cool? I'm an ice cube. We'll go on and take the next one. Look at all this groovy stuff. Man, we could play Halloween. Check this, Scooby. Give me liberty, or give me pizza pie. Hey, Shag. That's great, Scooby. Hey, here's one of those jiffy cameras. It develops a shot in less than a minute. I'll take your picture. - Act fierce. - Okay. Great. Do another. How's this? I've gotta wind in another frame. That's the Ape Man in the mirror without his mask on. Look out, Scooby! The Ape Man! Gangway! I got it! Hey, gang, I got the Ape Man on film. That's Shaggy and Scooby! I got a picture of the Ape Man without his mask. He's right behind us. Quick! Run for the house so we can trap him. Keep going right up the stairs and don't stop. Help! Hey, look at this snapshot. Here's a clue to end all clues. Take a look at our Ape Man. It's Carl, the stuntman! Yep, Carl decided to sabotage the picture just because I wouldn't let him play the lead. What a pity. It sure was clever of him to lock himself in that trunk yesterday. And tell that phony story about the Ape Man throwing him in. Well, I can't thank you kids enough. Shaggy should get most of the credit. Where is Shaggy? Oh, no, not again. Looks like Shaggy wants to try for the Ape Man role in the picture. Surprise. But there's Scooby-Doo in the other chair. Surprise. It's the Scooby head the Ape Man was wearing. Now, there's real talent. We sure fooled them, Scooby. We ought to be in the movies. Yeah. Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
Time to go, gang. It's getting dark. - Hey, let's have that last clam, Scooby. - Coming up. Scooby-Doo! Good shot! I've heard of bird dogs and rabbit dogs but you're the first clam dog I ever heard of. Clam dog? Shaggy, you know Scooby doesn't like clams. I like them. They're fun to dig and even more fun to eat. Don't you wish Funland was open? The root-beer floats, the chocolate custard, the rides. Man, that's living. Yes, but right now it looks a little spooky -  even haunted. - Haunted? Don't be silly, Daphne. Hey, look at that! But that's impossible. That place won't be open for weeks. Look! Well, this calls for a little investigation. It's hard to believe. Everything's running, but nobody's here. Man, it's a dream come true. Let's check out that lunch counter over there, Scooby. A little service, please? For openers, I'd like a malt and a hot dog with all the trimmings. Me too. Who did that? Hey, I used to be pretty good at this. - Should I give it a whirl? - Go ahead. - Who's to know? - Okay. Batter up! Good throw, Freddy! Well, I've still got the old touch. Let's go find Shaggy and Scooby. Gee, Freddy, shouldn't we stack those bottles back up? You're right, Daphne. Look! The bottles are all stacked up again! And what's that on the counter? It's a prize for knocking down the bottles. Our backs were only turned for a minute. Oh, wow! Freddy, this is really weird. Well, somehow I got this prize, so the least I can do is pay my 2 bits. What a cute kewpie doll. Oh, no! The cash register rang up 25 cents. I'm beginning to wonder if this place is haunted. Scooby, do you think we stand a chance of getting some cotton candy too? - Yeah! - Hold it. I just saw somebody. There he goes again! Man, he's faster than a speeding bullet. Superman! Come on, Scooby. Pick up the scent. - No scent. - No scent? He has to have a scent. Why, he'd have to be a ghost not to leave a scent. Did I say "ghost"? - What's the matter with you? - I'm pointing. You're pointing? Oh! I see him. That was no ghost. He looks more like a man from Mars. Wow! Look what that last hot dog did to me! Look at me! I knew I was sharp but this pointed head is too much. A giant mouse! That's no giant mouse. It's only a little mouse. Scooby-Doo, where are you? There he is! What do you say? Let's go find the others. Scooby-Doo! I'm with you! I don't see Scooby or Shaggy anywhere. There's someone going along behind that fence. It's no one we know. But whoever it is, I'd like to ask him a few questions. He's taking a ride on the Ferris wheel. It stopped. That man is trapped up on top. I'll get him down. I want to talk to him. I'll have to crank the wheel down by hand. We can't leave him up there. You've turned it all the way around, but he's gone. He couldn't have climbed down without us seeing. Look! The lights are going off all over the park! Well, this is the first time I ever wanted to leave Funland. Scooby and I saw him. Strictly a weirdo from outer space. - We saw him too. - Look. I wonder whose house that is. It could be the caretaker. Let's go see. We should tell him about these mysterious happenings. I hope he's a nice, sweet old caretaker. And believe me, Mr. Jenkins, all the rides were running. - I don't see how. - Well, she was sure running wide-open. - Lights, music, everything. - That's impossible. We're the caretakers here. My brother and I would've seen the lights. - Sarah's right. - Well, we saw a very strange character -  running around out there. - He was, like, weirdo. - Weirdo-like. - Fiddlesticks! Besides us, there's no one else on this island. - Maybe the moonlight was playing tricks. - But, man, I tell you- Let it go. Sorry to have bothered you, sir. Let's go, gang. Well, how did you like that for double talk? We can't go home now. We know we didn't imagine -  all those kooky things that happened. - Count me out. I'm not looking for any creep with a frozen face. Shaggy, sometimes I think you'd rather eat pizza pie than solve a mystery. - Let's vote on it. Mystery or pizza pie? - Pizza pie. Cut it out, you two. Come on, let's get back to the beach. - Okay. We'll keep a watch from here. - It's sure dark. What do they call this, a stakeout? I'd rather have a steak-in. Like, a sirloin steak in me, that is. Me too. Yeah! - Oh, stop it! Stop it! I can't stand it! - Be quiet, you two. We've been here an hour, and no sign of life. We'll give it 10 minutes more. Is that music I hear? - Look! All the lights are going on! - Here we go again! No doubt this time. Let's get over there, quick! - Something's haywire. - What's wrong with the merry-go-round? It's running backwards. Look at that cotton-candy machine. It's running wild! And the hot-dog stand. I can't stand it! What's the matter, Scooby? I like to eat too, you know. Look! There's that strange guy again. - What a time for a sideshow. - Come on, everybody. After him! Look what he's doing. What's wrong with him? Help! Shaggy, he's got me! Let go! Let go! He got me! He got me! Help! No, he didn't. There he goes now into the Tunnel of Love. So we have to go into the tunnel after him. I want to go, like, home. Row faster! We can catch him! - There's something in that tunnel! - It's him! - He's swimming right at us! - I thought we wanted to catch him. Like a torpedo, he's going to ram us! Don't panic! I'll save you! Thanks, Shaggy, but why don't we just walk out. Oh, yeah. Good idea. That's no ordinary man. He's going to be hard to track down. He'd better look out I don't catch him. I'll make him pay for what he did to my hair. - Let's go back. - We can't go back, Scooby. Freddy said to look on this side of the park. It's okay just to look for the torpedo man, as long as we don't find him. What's that? Oh, that. That's a real fun game, Scooby. Come on. I'll show you how it works. Now, you take this hammer, and you hit that button. The ball goes up to the top and rings the bell. Now watch the old master. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Now I got it! - Hey, what you doing? - My turn. Your turn? With your tail? Let me out of the way. Scooby-Doo! Hey, that was great! You gotta have the strongest tail in the world. It's him. He wins! Let's go, man! He's gaining on us! Head for the roller coaster! He's climbing up the cars after us! Let's go, Scooby! Here we go! We're trapped! Look! There's Shaggy and Scooby in the front seat of that car! And that strange man is after them! There's an empty car going up the other track. I'll slow it down, and maybe they'll jump into it. Jump, Shaggy! - They made it! - Scooby-Doo! Nice jump, you guys. Thanks, gang. But don't ever let us do that again. I think that character's train is coming in. Everybody hide behind those crates. But it's empty. How could he get out? Look! He's up there! What's he going to do? He's diving off! - Come on! He could be hurt! - Let's go, Scooby! He's not here! - He crashed through the tent there. - You can see where he hit the crate. - It defies all the known laws of physics. - I wish you could have seen his eyes. - Like two taillights on a hot rod. - Yeah! Hot rod! Hot rod! That's it! The answer is, that this guy can move so fast we need something fast to catch him. We're gonna soup up this electric car to catch him? Right. We'll increase the flow of power from the battery. This might jazz it up. No, Shaggy! You turned it on at the motor! Now Velma can't stop it! My glasses! I lost them! There's no brakes, Scooby, and I can't see without my glasses. But it's a nice, wide street. Oh, don't fret, Scooby. - Hey, that's him! - Oh, I see the traffic cop, silly. Right turn, isn't it? Go, Velma! Hey, Scooby, are we in the right lane now? Right lane? Train coming! Train coming? I told you I can't stop. The train will just have to look out for itself. Here they come! Look out for the cotton candy, Velma! - I think we've stalled. - Wow, at least you're safe. What luck. What do you mean, luck? We didn't have a bit of trouble. Ask Scooby. Scooby-Doo! - Well, that does it. - But this guy is sure strong and fast. So we've had to build the prize trap of all time to catch him. And this crate is it. Now here's the plan. Someone will lure the stranger into this trap. But our man will be trapped in the crate with that weirdo. No. Look up there. We'll pull our man out of the trap in the basket. Shaggy'll lock the door, and Velma and I will pull up the basket. And all Scooby has to do is lure the stranger into the trap. - Anybody got a Scooby Snack? - No snacks. Not me. It's not fair. I'll go with Scooby. - We can use the dodgem car. - No car! I'll go! I'll go! Set the trap! Set the trap! Set the trap! Get ready, everyone! Here they come! We got him! - Scooby's safe! - We got him trapped! We got him! What was that? Like, you won't believe it. He went through the back of the trap then through a wooden crate and out the back through a brick wall! What a man! He's not human! You are absolutely right. He's not human. He's a robot. - It's Mr. Jenkins, the caretaker! - What did you say, sir? He's Charlie, the world's most perfect robot. I programmed him to operate everything in Funland. - But why? - I wanted to make enough robots -  to run the whole park. - What happened? Your robot's been tearing up the place. Somehow he got out of control. But we can stop him if you kids will help me. Here we go again. How does this equipment work? It's quite simple. Once we find Charlie the powerful electric magnet will pull his metal body to it. Slow down. Charlie's close by. Look at that needle. Turn on the big magnet. It's on. Aim it over at that shack. I saw something move. Don't fight it, Charlie. What happened? This cable has been cut. - Charlie's crashed! - I was afraid of that. The electromagnet has fouled up his circuits. Hey, Scooby's up to something. Somebody's behind that fence. Come out of there! Sarah! What are you doing here? It was me that caused Charlie to go out of control. I don't think robots should work where children come to have fun. She's right. Charlie is nice, but kids need humans. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! - I never thought about that. I just wanted a perfect robot. But never mind. I'll rebuild him and call him "Charlie the Second. " Well, kids, Charlie's repaired, and I think he's better than ever. That great, Mr. Jenkins. We came back today to see if you had him fixed up. - Hey, where's Scooby? - Well, would you look at that? He's getting his ears scratched. Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy! Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
Say, Scooby, kind of a spooky night, huh? Yeah, spooky. The aroma of this pizza is, like, driving me wild. You wanna eat it now? Like, right this minute? - Yeah, yeah! - Man, this is gonna be delicious. After all, we only had two blockbuster pizzas at the Pizza Palace. That's hardly even a snack. I always wanted to be a pizza chef. Watch this. Well, thanks for leaving my finger. Maybe that's the gang in the Mystery Machine. Hey, mister! You lost something! I guess he didn't hear me. Let's go see what it is. It's a violin case. It feels kind of heavy. Yeah, I know, and you never had a lesson in your life. Holy moly! What's this? It's full of money! - There must be thousands of dollars. - Millions. - Here, hold this. - Me? Yes, you. Guard that while I go phone the gang. Trouble. What's wrong? It's gone! I goofed. What happened, Scooby? Where's the violin case full of money? - I got you. You put the case on the curb. - Yeah. Then what? - Girl dog. - A girl dog with big eyelashes. She was in trouble. You put the violin case down and went over to see her. And while you were gone, someone took the case. - Show us where the girl dog was. - Okay. Here. Let's look around. There might be a clue. It'd be better if we knew what we were looking for. What's this? It's a puppet control. I wonder what it's doing here. Let me see it. Something is written on this control. "Pietro's Puppets. " That must be the puppet show at the Strand. - You think the other dog was a puppet? - Yeah, yeah. So it was the girl-dog puppet that lured you away from the violin case. - Right! Right! - We have ourselves a little mystery. Let's examine the clues: A puppet dog, a violin case packs of brand-new bills. Very strange. They don't seem to hold together. Unless - You've got it. - That's it. Counterfeiters! The thing to do is get in the Strand Theater and look around. But how? How about getting an audition for a trained dog act? - "Trained dog"? - That's a great idea. Trained dog? Don't look now, fans, but I think a star is about to be born. - There's someone inside. - Likely a watchman or a doorman. Look, he's working a puppet. Could be another clue for us, all right. Let's go inside. - Hello. - Well, hello. What can I do for you? We're inquiring about arranging an audition for our trained dog. He's a great talent. Do a bit, Scooby. Well, that was pretty good. What do you say, Johnny? No. Sorry, chum, but you can't work this show unless you're a puppet. - You're very good. You a puppet master? - No, I just fiddle with them as a hobby. You're okay with me, Pop. Well, you certainly seem professional. Well, why not? The great Pietro has helped me. How long have-? - What's with him? - Yeah, what's with you, Scooby-Doo? A witch! A witch! A witch? I get it. One of the puppets scared you. Okay, let me up. - You'll have to excuse him. - That's okay. I'll go put Johnny away. Shaggy, look. Look what I got. A brand-new bill, just like in the violin case. Quick, hide it. - Now, about that audition- - Not right now. We've really got to go. - What? - What's the rush? Freddy's right. We really gotta go. Well, we sure enjoyed the puppets. Goodbye. Anytime. Anytime. Goodbye. Well, why the rush? We didn't get a chance to look for clues. - Show them the clue, Shaggy. - It was in the doorman's desk drawer. - A brand-new $20 bill. - And I'll bet you a doughnut it's a phony. - It sure looks real. - Let's change it into a blockbuster pizza. Yeah! Be serious. My expert opinion on the authenticity of this bill is: - It's absolutely genuine. - That 20 was planted to throw us off? - How come? - Yeah, like, why? To make us think nothing fishy was going on there. So we wouldn't think of going back. - I get it. But now what do we do? - We go back. Oh, no. We're in luck. The doorman's asleep. Come on, the door's unlocked. Let's give this stage a good going-over. - What are we looking for? - Clues, of course. Any kind of clues. Why not start here in the clues closet? Nope. Nothing here. Shaggy, that's the worst joke I ever heard. Be serious, you guys. Let's split up and start searching. Everybody know the signal? - Do you know the signal, Scooby? - Sure. - Quiet. - Sorry. Yeah, like, watch it. You stay close to Scooby. We don't want any more noise. Okay? Let's go. Wow. There's a lot of searching to do around these old sets. - We better split up and look around. - Right. Don't forget, if you see anything suspicious bark three times. - Scoob, watch what you bump into. - I didn't do it. A guy could get hurt around here. Come on, let's look somewhere else. Gee, Velma, I wish we had a clue to a clue. Don't worry, Daphne. If we stick around here, we're bound to find something. Wow, we almost got hit by that sandbag! Yeah, I guess the rope must have broke. Broke, nothing. Look. It's been cut with a knife. And ropes don't cut themselves. - Let's look in the dressing room area. - Okay, Shaggy. There should be a lot of junk in here to check over. - Let's browse around here a bit. - Right. - What's with you, Scooby-Doo? - He's after me! - He's after you? - Yeah, yeah! It's only a jack-in-the-box. - Stop clowning around and keep looking. - Right. Funny faces. Hey, Scooby, check this. Pretty heroic, huh? Yeah, yeah. Watch this. That's great. Hold it a sec. The cloaked cavalier. That's a doozy. - There were two of you! - There were two of me? I don't get it. Give me. - Two of you. - You saw somebody dressed like me? - Yeah, yeah. - Let's get out of here! I wish I knew what we were looking for. - We'll know when we find it. - Yeah, if we find it. Daphne. Velma. Come over here. I saw him! He was in that prompter's box! Run! Get out of here! - There's a guy in a black cape around. - He was in that prompter's box. We ought to see what's in there. Right, Scooby? Not me. Here's a Scooby Snack. No strings attached. Just catch. Dirty trick. What's down there, Scooby? - Violin cases. - Violin cases? Well, come on. Let's get down below stage. Quick. - What now? They're all empty. - Not even violins in them. Maybe this thing is a wild-goose chase. How about that man in the black cape? Explain him. And Scooby, he saw that man in the black too, didn't you? Somebody's playing the big organ on the stage. - He's gone! - It must have been our imagination. Well, that was the first time I ever heard mine. - What was that? - I don't like looking for clues anymore. That's the one. Look, Scooby has a dog puppet. So this is the canine Mata Hari. What's sticking out of that puppet's stuffing? What a clue! It's the front engraving plate for a $20 bill. Time to wake that doorman up and tell him what's going on. Good idea. Let's go. Mr. Doorman, wake up! Wake up! Come on, wake up! It- It- - He's a puppet too! - That's all for me, fans. We're locked in! But good. But we've got to get out with this important clue. - There goes the plate, our only clue! - What will we do now? We're going back to that violin case room and give it another going-over. - Okay, how do we start? - Look for something out of the ordinary. Take a good look around. - That harp case could hide something. - I wonder if it's empty too. It's sure not empty. It's got a whole room in it! Wow! We hit the jackpot. Look at that printing press! And all those new $20 bills on the table. You were right, Freddy, it's a big counterfeit operation. It's him! - Yipes! - Double yipes! Let's get out of here! There's a door up ahead! You know my secret! - Golly! Where's that voice coming from? - In this tunnel. Who knows? It's a dead end! This ladder's our only way. But I can't see where it goes. We got no choice. Start climbing. - Where are we? - I'm not sure. You have learned my secret. Now you can never go! Come on, think of something. Look, one man isn't too heavy. If we all push together -  maybe we can throw him off. - Okay, let's go. Where did he go? - Where are we? - Back on the stage. Careful, everybody. He's around here some place. Wait for me. - Wait a minute. - Me, wait? Why? There's nothing to be afraid of. Remember the doorman? - He was a life-sized puppet, wasn't he? - Yes. - What do you think these are? - You're right: Puppets. Then there must be a puppet master. - There he is! We've got to catch him! - Look at Scooby-Doo! How do you like that? Old Scooby-Doo's got him on the run! Good work, Scooby! I'll give you a hand! You deserve a lot of credit. This town's been flooded with phony 20s for weeks. It was nothing, really. But old Mr. Pietro, posing as the doorman, sure had us fooled for a while. He gave himself away when he put on his puppet show for us. The real hero is Scooby-Doo. By the way, where is he? Oh, no. Look at him. Like I said before, what a ham. Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
Hey, what's happening? Watch it! We're going to fall! I can't control it! What's going on down the road? Dig that crazy drag race! Hey, those men are in trouble! Come on. Let's see if we can help. - Are you all right? - Where's the little man? He flew over there somewhere. Help! Over here! Help! Help! I'm slipping! - Scooby-Doo! - Good boy, Scooby. Great going, Scooby-Doo. That's the way to do it. - Wow. What a catch! - Thattaboy, Scoob. Hey, Scooby, you're some cow pony. Thanks. I'm Max the Midget. And the big fellow is Samson the Strongman. - Glad to meet you. - Glad to meet you both. - That was some accident you had. - That was no accident. Someone fixed that bike to break in half. Who would do such a terrible thing? Never mind. That circus we quit was jinxed. - Right, Max? - It's jinxed all right, Sam. Let's get this bike back together and get out of here. - Well, good luck. - Yeah. So long, kids. If I were you, I'd get out of this neck of the woods. And fast! What kind of a jinx would make them leave the circus? - Search me. - Well, let's go see. I'm sure sorry to hear that Max and Samson took off. That's the last straw. Now my circus won't open this year. That's too bad, Mr. Barnstorm. Tell me, what is this jinx anyway? This circus is haunted by a ghost clown. A ghost clown? A ghost clown? Yes. When the ghost clown appears in your circus you might as well quit. Circus folks are superstitious. But there are no such things as ghosts, Mr. Barnstorm. Well, there's so many strange things going on. What sort of strange things, Mr. Barnstorm? Weird things. Like trapeze wires suddenly coming undone. And then the lions. They suddenly began acting like scared pussycats. Believe me, that ghost clown is here. You kids had better leave the grounds -  and go straight home. - I'm all for that. Good night, Mr. Barnstorm. Ghost clowns haunting circuses is a new one on me. Hey, where's Scooby-Doo? Watch the pretty coin of gold and you will do what you are told. You are brave, and that's a fact. You will do the high-wire act. Scooby-Doo! Where are you? Scooby-Doo! Where are you? No sign of him. Let's check in this tent. It's the big top. Look at all the trapeze stuff. There's Scooby! And look at what he's doing! Scooby, get down! - He acts like he's in a trance. - He did it! Where did he learn to do that? Come on, Shaggy, we've got to stop him. Quick! Grab this trampoline! Let's get it under Scooby. Now you stay here and try to catch him. - And I'll go up and try to help him. - Okay. I'm coming, Scooby-Doo. The power of the ghost clown is great. It's time for that silly dog to wake. You shall not work in this circus. Huh? Where am I? Scooby, be careful! You're on the trapeze wire. The wire? Oh, no! - Hey, Scooby-Doo! - Wire? Yipe! Here's an umbrella to help you balance. Catch! Thanks! Scooby, pop the chute! Great! You got it made. Scooby-Doo! Scooby-Doo! Hey, I'm falling up! He's falling up. All that goes up must come down. They're shooting at me. Shooting at you? I'll save you! Coming, Scooby! A clown's rubber ladder. I should have known. Gotcha! We saved you, Scooby. Yeah. Thanks a lot. Where could they be? - Not a sign of Scooby yet. - Freddy, what's that? - Looks like the ghost clown. - Let's see what he's up to. He's going into the costume tent. He could be hiding anywhere in here. You go left, and I'll go right. I'd better check this giant steamer trunk. Freddy, what is it? Freddy! Where are you? You will pay attention for a time. And soon your thoughts shall all be mine. Watch the pretty coin of gold and you will do as you are told. I wonder if that ghost clown is still here in the big top. Let's, like, give a look. - What's that? - It's Daphne on a unicycle. She can't even ride a bicycle. - She's in a trance, just like Scooby was. - We got to wake her up. Yeah, yeah, yeah! She's coming back! Now's our chance. Give me a hand, Scooby. Grab the stampede net! Hang on! Here she comes! She's heading out of the big top. We mustn't lose her! Shaggy! Scooby! Daphne went in the animal tent. - Hurry! Maybe we can catch her. - Animal tent? Let's go. Look at Daphne ride along the top of those elephants. She could get hurt. Look! Now she's coming back! - We got to wake her up! - I'll do it! Not me! Her! Now! What? Hey! Stop it! - That woke her up! - Hey, Daphne! You're okay now. Will you tell me what I'm doing in this silly costume? - And all wet? - You were in a trance. We had to wake you up. Where's Freddy? Freddy? We were in the costume tent. Then all went blank. Costume tent. We'd better get over there and find him, like, fast. This is really weird. I was locked in the trunk, and you were in a trance. Don't you remember anything, Daphne? I remember something about money. The rest is a blank. How did he do it? The only way we'll answer that is to ask the ghost clown himself. Now, here's the perfect trap. One of us gets the ghost clown to chase him into the cage. Then our man ducks out the door at the other end. Which is closed by releasing a rope, and then we have him caged. And who's the bait for this trap? The fastest runner, that's who. Scooby-Doo. Sprained ankle! That sprained-ankle act won't work, Scooby. Anybody have a Scooby snack? I think this calls for a bigger reward, don't you, Daphne? I sure do! Here's a super-duper hero sandwich! Okay, Scooby? - Yeah! Yeah! - Hold it! You forgot I'm a track man. I can really run, and fast! - But I'm faster. - Why don't you both go -  and split the sandwich? - Good idea. Okay by me. Hold it, Scooby. That's him. That's the ghost clown. Let's surround him. You go that way. And I'll go this way. Watch the pretty coin of gold and you will do as you are told. You are brave, and that's a fact. So you will do the lion-tamer's act. Back up there, Simba! Roll over, Simba! Shaggy! What's he doing? Now, Simba, stand! Stand, Simba! Shaggy? Very good, but now the ghost clown strikes. Back, Simba! Back! When I blow this whistle, you won't be a lion-tamer. You'll be a tasty snack for a hungry lion. - Down, Simba! - Shaggy! Up, Simba! Up! Down! Up! Down! Shaggy! Back, Simba! Back! Shaggy! Shaggy! Give me that whistle. Quick, Shaggy! Wake up! Oh, hi, Scooby. Yipe! Here, Shaggy! - Huh? Where did he go? - Over here. Here I am. What you waiting for? So they think they have escaped me. Man, he's after us! Back to the cage and the hero sandwich! He's coming! Drop the door! We got him! Way to go! Hooray! Good work, gang. Now we'll unmask the ghost. You fools will never capture the ghost clown! Don't tell me there are two of them. Look! The one in the cage is gone. I can't believe it. I would have bet money we had him. Money? Hey, that's it. A gold coin! I have an idea about this ghost, Scooby. And we're going out again. Not again! Watch the pretty coin of gold and you both shall do as you are told. Now, Scooby! You both have fur. You both are limp. You swing from trees like a happy chimp. Watch the pretty coin of gold. Be chimpanzees as you are told! Look what Shaggy and Scooby brought in on a leash. They got him! But what's going on? Simple. He hypnotized himself. I know that man. He's Harry the Hypnotist. He had an act with us, but we caught him stealing and sent him to prison. Looks like he wanted to get revenge. As a ghost clown, he knew he could ruin your circus. He had us fooled with this balloon copy of the ghost clown. He inflated it with this gas cartridge. And it disappeared when he deflated it. Well, it was great work, kids. Thanks to you, my circus will open this year after all. Shaggy and Scooby sure were mysterious about this big surprise they have for us. I hope Scooby doesn't try that high-wire act again. Ladies and gentlemen presenting that Hercules among strongmen. The man with muscles of steel. Samson the Super! If he can lift that, he is Samson. What an act! It's great! What a pair of hams. They're a riot.
Hey, there it is, gang. Franken Castle. It's the only castle ever imported from Transylvania. - I can hardly wait to see inside it. - I can wait. Remember those stories about werewolves in Transylvania? - Werewolves? - Werewolves? - Look, a gypsy wagon. - "Fortune told. " Let's stop. Daphne, fortunetelling is all nonsense. You'd like your fortune told, wouldn't you, Scooby? - Yeah, yeah. - Okay, it might be fun. So you want your fortunes told. Gather round, my pretties, and we'll peer into the crystal ball. Spirits rise and spirits fall Reveal your secrets, tell us all Yes, you children are on a pleasure trip. But what's this? I see great danger as long as you stay in these mountains. - What kind of danger? - Evil forces from the world of the dead. Werewolves. There are no werewolves, Scooby. You come back here. What does your crystal ball say about Franken Castle? Not the castle. The caretaker ran away in fear today. I warn you, you will meet your doom if you go there. Maybe we shouldn't go to the castle. Yeah, those werewolf cats come out, like, tonight, when the moon is full. Yeah, moon is full. Nonsense, we can't let a superstitious old gypsy scare us off. - Hello, is anybody home? - The caretaker got scared away. What a pad for ghosts. Well, we can't get in. Let's go home. Wait a minute. Let's get out and look around first. Look at that. And there's not a cloud in the sky. Looks like the caretaker came back. Let's cross. See? Everything's all right. Stop. You are not welcome in the castle. Go now or abandon all hope of seeing the sun again. You stop that. We have permission to visit this castle. Go. This is your last warning. It's a vampire bat. The bridge is going up. Everybody jump! - Daphne didn't make it. - Can you get me back across? - Zoinks! Look at that creep. - He's after Daphne. - Run, Daphne, run! - Don't worry, I'm running. Shaggy, we've gotta get across that moat. I'll lasso that statue. You and Scooby can swing over. - We can? - Not me. - You've got to do it to save Daphne. - Okay, let it go. Scooby-Doo! Hang on, Scooby. Alligator! You missed me. - They made it. - Stand guard. I'll lower the drawbridge. Yes, sir. Who's that? I got it. You have to pull out this locking bar. Hey, stop that clowning around, Scooby. A werewolf. Hold this, friend. Scooby-Doo, where are you? Scooby-Dooby-Doo! Scooby, we gotta hide. I'll hide up on that window ledge. - And you hop in the piano. - Gotcha. Time for a little ventriloquism. Where you going, fuzzy face? I'll give it to him again. You must be the big, bad wolf. Ivory piano keys? Good boy. Back him up just a little more. Now! That's just how I planned it. Now get me down. Jump. Hurry, he's trying to get loose. I wonder where Shaggy and Scooby could be. I don't know. But let's check out that room up ahead. A fire. Maybe we're expected for dinner. Fine, as long as we're not the dinner. Hey, who's that? So you didn't heed my warning? Now your spirits will dwell here in this house forever. Duck, Velma. Hey, my glasses. I can't see without them. They should be around here somewhere. Velma? Velma, are you all right? She's gone. But where? The coast is clear. Come on, Scooby. I think we gave old fuzzy face the slip. - How about a snack? Check the fridge. - Yeah, yeah. - Boy, there should be something good. - Shaggy, come here. - What is it? - Look. Wow, pickled vampire wings. Yuck. Werewolf snacks? Fried Moonbeams? Double yuck-yuck. - What a menu. - Yuck. Check the pantry, and I'll look into those canisters. Peekaboo. It's locked. Hello? Open the door. After all, what could be in the pantry? A big one. What big one? Help, I'm falling! A white ghost. Save me. - He got me! - It's me, Scooby. Daphne, Freddy, where are you? Shaggy, is that you over there? It must be the playroom. There are so many interesting toys. Somebody's coming. Hey, it's an old torture chamber. Look over there. - Yikes, it's a skeleton. - Back upstairs. It's just an old skeleton. He can't hurt us. Come on. - What do you smell? - Scooby Snacks. That's ridiculous. There can't be any Scooby Snacks down here. - See? Scooby Snacks. - I don't believe it. Who did that? I did. I'm sure glad you two showed up. - Shaggy, have you got my extra glasses? - Yeah, here they are. Thanks. Now, that's better. - How did I get in this horrible room? - I don't know, but- - Help! Help me. - Who's that? It sounded like Daphne. Come on. It is Daphne. Down in that dungeon. - What happened? - A weird man chased me into this room. We'll get you out, Daphne. - Grab this rope, Daph. - I have it. Stop that, you mutt. Get him, Scooby. Stop, I say. Stop it, you silly mutt. - Are you all right, Daphne? - I'm okay. Let's get out of here. - Attaboy, Scooby. - You'll pay for this. You haven't escaped me yet. Speaking of escaping, let's get out of here. Scooby-Doo! - Man, this is dark in this tunnel. - I can hardly see even with my glasses. Now, stay close together. It's getting darker. - Isn't that a crack of light up ahead? - Yes, it is. Shaggy, you'd better lead from now on. - Shaggy? Scooby? - They were behind me, but they're gone. - Hey, girls. - It's Freddy. I'm glad I found you. What have you found out? We found Daphne in a dungeon. - And I found a clue. - A clue? What is it? I wrote down a message written on the dungeon wall in 1668. It says, "I have fooled them all. I may perish -  but I'll be as rich as King Tut. " - Tut was an Egyptian. They kept their wealth by having it buried with them. This calls for a visit to the crypt but first we have to find Scooby and Shaggy. Man, like, wow. It's a mad scientist's rumpus room. Look in that corner. Old square-head's on the table. Let's get him. You jerk the sheet off him, and I'll blast him. He'll be one soggy ghost. - Soggy ghost. - Okay, all set? - Yes. - One, two, three, go! Take that, ghost! Sorry about the free bath, Scoob. Sorry. Okay. I'm the mad scientist. You're Igor, my assistant. We'll whip up a formula that'll change werewolves into pussycats. Give me a shot of that purple stuff, Igor. - Want a sip? - Yuck. - I call this a reject. - Me too. - Scary, eh, Shaggy? - Yeah, scary. You make a good monster, and I make a great mad doctor. Come on, I'll operate. Just hop up on the table. Now Did you put that sheet back on that table? Not me. - It's the real thing. - Hey, Shaggy. - Shaggy! - I forgot Scooby. Scooby-Doo. You did it, Scooby. Now pull the sheet out from under us. Okay, pop the chute. Scooby-Doo. Just in time. Man, what a ride. What do you mean, riding that cart around for fun? Well, since you got yourself lost, it seemed like a good idea. This clue is the only one we have. We'll go to the Franken crypt. - What's a crypt? - A tomb where you bury people. - A tomb? - Hey, come out from under that sheet. - I'm sick. - You're not sick. Okay, we'll leave you, but I'd hate to be here if those three creeps show up. Wait for me. We've searched the place, and no clue. The date carved on this one is the same as the clue. 1668. Shaggy, this stone lid rolls back. Give me a hand. - Who dares disturb my sleep? - Every man for himself! We fooled him, Scooby. If only we could set a trap for that ghoulish ghost. - Daphne, this way. - Back to the crypt. Hey, they're coming back. What are you doing? Use the tapestry for a trap? Great idea. Now, Scooby. It didn't stop him. Come on, we've got him trapped. Okay, heave. - It's empty! - What are those shiny things? A ruby, a diamond and a gold earring. I've seen this before. - Look. - Hey, look what Scooby found. Some pearls sewn in a piece of tapestry. That's what Daphne's clue meant. The jewels were sewn into the tapestry. - The ghost took it. - But he left us this clue. This earring resembles the one the gypsy had. I think we'd better pay her another visit. I'm surprised to see you, my pretties. Did you enjoy your visit to the castle? - We might ask you the same question. - Me? I never go to the castle. - Look, Scooby's got the tapestry. - Give me that, you mutt. Get him, Scooby. Good work, Scooby. Look, a police car. The caretaker from the castle reported some trouble. Who is this on the ground? Why, it's Big Bob Oakley, alias The Actor. He's a master of disguises and wanted in seven states. That explains a lot. He's been haunting the castle to scare people away. He was after the jewels woven in that tapestry. I'd have gotten away with it if it wasn't for these kids and their dog. You kids deserve a big thanks. I'll take Oakley and the jeweled tapestry into custody. I don't understand how Oakley pulled that trick with the bat. Yeah, we forgot to ask about that. There it is, the vampire bat. Save my sandwich. It's only a stuffed bat on a wire. Scooby, I always knew you were a little batty. Scooby-Dooby-Doo.
This is the Mummy of Anka. Once the most feared ruler of ancient Egypt. Wow! He could still scare me, professor. Don't worry about him, Daphne. Anka is over 3000 years old. That's funny. He doesn't look a day over 2000 to me. Two thousand! Thanks to Dr. Najib the Mummy of Anka completes the university's replica of his tomb. I only hope that the curse of Anka did not follow, professor. Curse? What curse? Anka vowed that if he were ever removed from his tomb he would come back to life and turn those responsible to stone. A most ominous curse, I must say. As all ancient ones are. Now, if you'll excuse me, professor it's time for me to take my leave. Well, thank you again, Dr. Najib. I bid you all good night. Well, do you kids still want to stay and help me tonight? It'll take more than a silly, superstitious curse to scare us off. Hey, professor, what kind of a crazy coin is this? It's part of an ancient mystery I haven't been able to solve yet. Well, could you solve how I can get a sandwich? I'm starving! - Me too! - Why don't you kids run downtown and bring back some sandwiches. I'll buy. - That's a deal, professor. - We'll be back in a jiff! What's that? My word! What could have done that? No! The Mummy of Anka is gone! Here you are, kids. The three hamburgers. And the sandwiches are coming up. Three liverwursts a la mode. One two three. Hey! - How much? - That'll be a buck-fifty. Here you are. $ 1.50 for a job well done. What kind of kooky 50-cent piece is this? - Hey! That's the old Egyptian coin! - Like, wow! I must have dropped it in my pocket by accident. We'll give it to the professor later. Grab the sandwiches, and let's go. Yeah. Like, I can't wait. Liverwurst and ice cream! What'll they think of next? Professor. Professor, we're back. Hey, professor, why are you sitting in the dark? - I'll get the lights. - Okay. - Professor! - Zoinks! What happened to him? Like, he's turned into 14-karat stone! Stone? There's only one person who could've done that. - The mummy! - The mummy! Mummy! Let's go check. Velma's right. The mummy's not in the case. It's gone! And, like, right out through that glass door. Wait a minute. If he went out the door how come the broken glass is on the inside of the door? You're right. There's something strange going on around here. Gosh! It looks like we've found ourselves another mystery. And we're gonna solve it. The first thing to do is split up and search the school for clues. - Like, what kind of a clue? - The mummy! What else? I don't know how we'll find the mummy with you two making so much noise. Make noise! That's the idea! Right, Scooby? - Yeah! Yeah! Noise! - That's not the idea. Now put that stuff in the closet and come on! Spoilsport! Oh, thanks. Zoinks! The mummy! That does it! Punch my face, will you? - You found him! - Yeah. He's locked in the closet. - Now what do we do? - Run! Oh, no! We're back where we started! He's right behind us! Come on! Let's hide! Here we go again! Wow! What a time to find a locked door! Shoo! Go away! Yeah. Your mummy's calling you. Oh, no sense of humor, huh? - Coin! Coin! - Coin? Okay. Like, here's a quarter. I'll bet he means that old Egyptian coin. Don't give it to him! Stop him, Scooby. - Not even for a Scooby Snack? - Okay. The whole box? Scooby-Dooby-Doo! Put them up! Put them up! Put them up! Put them up! Put them up! Thattaway, Scooby! Give him the old karate treatment! How do you like that? He danced out and deserted us. Yeah, but you gotta admit, he wasn't bad. Coin! Coin! I guess we'll have to give him the old coin, Shaggy. Yeah. Coin! Coin! Coin! - Good old Scooby! - I knew he wouldn't let us down. Now let's go find Daphne and Freddy and tell them we caught the mummy. Hey, Daphne, look! Footprints! And look how big they are! - They must be the mummy's. - Come on. Let's follow. And stick close to me. The footprints disappear here, where they're building an addition to the gym. Hey, look over there! Isn't that Dr. Najib's car? Yeah. I thought he left hours ago. - Dr. Najib? - Is he-? - He's turned to stone! - Poor Dr. Najib! He must have met the mummy before he could leave. I wonder if Shaggy and Velma met him yet. He's gone! The mummy's gone! And he didn't even wait till we found Fred and Daphne. Well, at least he left his calling card. It looks more like a piece of that tape he's all wrapped up in to me. It is, Shaggy. But it sure doesn't feel Come on. Let's go to the school lab and test it. This test will tell us just how old that tape really is. Well, come on, like, hurry. This place makes me so nervous all I can think of is food. Me too! Now, let's see. Where is the potassium disulfate? Oh, thanks. This should- I wish I hadn't seen what I think I saw. - Coin! Coin! - Zoinks! It's the creepy coin collector again. Pardon me. It's time for a smoke-screen exit. Like, let's get out of here. - Velma! Shaggy! - What's going on? We got the mummy trapped inside. Groovy! But where's Scooby? Like, he's trapped inside too. - Scooby? - Mr. Mummy? - They're not here. - We forgot about the back window. Then that creep must have Scooby! We better find him before he ends up like the professor and Dr. Najib. - Dr. Najib? - Dr. Najib? We found him, solid as a rock. Poor Scooby! Scooby! Like, wow! Too late! He's gone to that big boneyard in the sky. Oh, my old pal! I'll never see his hungry face again! - Shaggy? - Look, Scoob. You've been turned to stone! Wait a minute. Scooby! - You're all right! - Yeah. Scooby-Doo! Okay. Cut it out. Cut it out. - Look! Shaggy's found Scooby! - Yeah. Two of them. Get a load of this, gang. Like, a stone one and a real one. - I don't get it. - I don't get a lot of things. Like why is the mummy after that goofy old coin? Let's go to the professor's office. Maybe we can dig up some answers to this mystery. Come on! Here. According to the professor's research not only was Anka the most feared ruler of ancient Egypt but the richest. Now, that's what I call a riches-to-rags story! Riches-to-rags? - But what about the coin? - I think I found something. Look at the design work on the statue in this photo. - It looks like a picture puzzle to me. - Right. And take a look at one of the pictures in that puzzle when it's magnified. Wow! It's the same as the coin! So that's it! Big, bad and bandaged is back! And he looks mad. Gangway! Class dismissed! We're safe here on the second floor. We can't let him get that coin. - Not quite safe enough. - Quick! Into the wood shop. Dead end! Quick, Daphne! The lights! We'll lose him in the dark. Oh, no! Danger-prone Daphne turned on the power saw! We're surrounded! We landed in the pool. Zoinks! Now that crazy saw is after us! Let's paddle out of here! - Well, we lost him. - Yeah, and, like, I gotta rest. I'm tiredsville. And my feet are killing me. All one, two, three, four of them. Zoinks! The mummy! Hey, like, what's this? "Quick drying mold cement. " And spray molds. Is that how the creep made stone statues of everyone? Here we go again! I don't hear anything. I think we lost him. Zoinks! He's sealing us in! Coin! Coin! Coin! Coin! You shouldn't have done that, Scoob. Now he's really sore at us. What's that? Hey! It's the professor! - Are you all right, professor? - I'm fine. Groovy. Be back for you later. Okay, Scoob. Start her up. We're going out the back way. Right. Cut the switch! - There's Shaggy and Scooby! - What are they doing with that mower? Turn it off! Here comes creepy again! Quick. Hide in the gym and lock the door. The mummy! I hope that baseball bat holds. - Like, what happened? - You let the mummy in. And Scooby's with him! Scooby, look out! Wow! What a shot! Well, Scooby-Dooby-Doo! Now let's see who's really behind these bandages. Dr. Najib! So it was apparent that Dr. Najib knew the secret of the coin. And after you kids left, he broke in, hoping to steal it. But when I surprised him, he had to tie me up in the shack. And when he couldn't find the coin, he knew one of us must have it. So he devised this whole mummy plan to scare us into giving it to him. But we wouldn't give it to him, and later we figured out the secret. The coin fits into the design carved on the back of the hippo like a key. This looks like the slot. Now let's see what it unlocks. Wow! A secret compartment with a glass beetle in it! Not quite a glass beetle. It's Anka's most-valued treasure: - A diamond scarab worth a fortune. - So that's what he was after. But there's still one thing unsolved. What happened to the real mummy? Zoinks! The mummy! - Scooby-Doo! - It's Scooby! And he found the mummy! Well, gang, I guess that wraps up the mystery and the mummy too. Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
Some fishing trip this turned out to be. Like, not even a nibble! Well, it looks like Scooby isn't giving up yet. Hey, Shaggy, what kind of a creepy shortcut is Freddy taking? Search me, but it's creepy. I didn't know it ran through such a spooky swamp. This is the first time you've ever taken it? - Yeah, but it's the last time, I hope. - Oh, brother. We're lost. Maybe not. Look! There's someone up ahead. Let's ask him how to get out of here. Excuse me. Kind sir, can you show us the way to the main road? Zoinks! A zombie! Zombie? This is Swamp's End. I don't know where it is -  but I'm glad we found it. - Me too. I'd like to know more about that zombie. This looks like the place where you can find out. Yes, sirree. As strange as it may seem, I've seen the zombie you speak of and the old witch that brought him to life with her voodoo magic. Voodoo? You mean there's a witch living in that swamp too? Yep. She showed up about six months ago. Me and my partner Zeb went into the swamp to do some frog hunting. We heard a strange noise, and that's when we saw her. Smoke of darkness, demon of evil take the form of the living and come forth from the flame! And ever since then, no one's ever dared to go into the swamp. Like, wow. No wonder this town is deserted. Yep. Zeb and me are the only ones left. And he's so scared, he won't leave his cabin. I've never heard of such a thing. What's with Scooby-Doo? Oh, no! Scooby ate some jumping beans by mistake. Scooby, look out! I can't look. I'm sorry. Wow! What a mess. If we can borrow a broom, we'll clean it up. While we do, you and Scooby go to Zeb's place. Maybe you can find out something about this mystery. - You gotta be kidding. - Yeah, kidding. We're out of luck. This is Zeb Perkins' place, and we found it. I guess we better go in. Hello? Anybody home? Like, no one seems to be here, Scoob. And by the looks of this pad, I don't blame them. Thanks a lot. What was that? Someone's out there. Go see who it is, Scooby. Okay. We'll, like, flip a coin. Heads, I win. Tails, you lose. Okay. Tails. You lose. Oh, boy. Hey, Scooby. I think I found Zeb. Only I think the witch found him first. - This isn't Zeb, Shaggy. - I thought he shrunk. No. It's a voodoo doll that looks like him. What happened to Zeb? I don't know, but I'll bet that witch had something to do with it. I'd like to know what she and that zombie are up to. There's only one place to find the answer. Like, in the phone book, I hope. No, Shaggy. In the swamp. I had to ask. Look. It's the witch and her creepy crony. Come on. Let's follow them. Quietly, now. - They're gone. - Vanished. Yeah, but we're on the right trail. Look. "Beware of the witch. Go back. " "Enter at your own risk. " Risk? Oh, boy. Well, the trail led us to the witch's shack. Yeah, but no witch. But plenty of witch's wares. Look, here's some more of those crazy voodoo dolls. And they look just like us. She's trying to scare us off. Well, it won't work. That voodoo stuff is just a bunch of phony-baloney. Shaggy, voodoo. Yow! I've been voodooed! Hold it, Shaggy. All you did was back into this fork. So you dared enter the swamp in spite of my warning signs. You shouldn't believe everything you read. No, my pretty? I think you meddlers must be taught a lesson in witchcraft. Smoke of evil, make her vanish! Daphne! Poor Daphne. Gone forever in a puff of smoke. Yeah. All that's left are her footprints on that rug. There's something funny about those footprints. Look how they slide back to the edge of the rug. - That can only mean one thing. - She had big feet? No, silly. She slid down through a trap door in the floor. - So that's how it works. - But then what happened to Daphne? - I don't know. - Shaggy. - Footprints. - Footprints? Look what Scooby found! - I wonder where they go. - Let's follow them. Maybe they can lead us to the answer. Come on. - Zowie. - Look at that. - It's an old, derelict riverboat. - Those footprints lead right to it. Look! Look! - It's the zombie's boat. - Get a load of that boat pole. Like, it's got a kooky metal tip on it. I wonder what the tip is used for. For more than just pushing that boat around, I bet. Let's go aboard and hope we can find Daphne. Every time we split up, it's like I'm stuck with you. Now, do something about those chattering teeth. Now, stop that. Don't be such a fraidy cat. Come on. Fraidy cat? - I wonder what's inside this deck box. - Look. Hey, there's a pair of shoes in here. And look what they're attached to! Zoinks! Hey, a full house. Gee, thanks a lo- Yipe! Call her again, Freddy. Daphne? Daphne? Hey, did you hear that? - It's coming from the other side. - I wonder if there's a secret entrance. Maybe pulling on this lamp will open one. It always works in the movies. I never saw it done that way in a movie. It must have been in a soap opera. - What's that? - Yikes! A ghost. That sounds like Daphne. It is Daphne. Boy, am I glad to see you. - How did you get here? - Let me guess. Big and creepy brought you here, right? - None other. - Look what else we found here. A winch, power tools and a cutting torch. What would a witch want with a winch in a swamp? A metal-tipped pole and a winch I think I've got it. What? - Hey, look! - Wow, run! Quick! Down this coal chute. We would have to land in a coal pile. Well, at least we got away from that witch. The coast is clear. Okay. Now, keep it quiet. I got a baldheaded shadow. Two shadows? Yipe! Get lost! In here! Toads and snails and puppy-dog tails, that's what zombies are made of. Sugar and spice and everything nice that's what ugly, old witches are made of. Hey, Scoob, I think we fooled him. Yeah. - Dumb zombie. - Yeah, dumb zombie. Yipe! Shaggy, help! Zoinks! He's got Scooby! Help! Help! Hang on, Scoob. Here's a Scooby Snack to the rescue. Scooby-Doo! Let go! Go back. We're trapped between those two gruesomes. Look! The witch's broom. Look, we win. Let's fly out of here, Scoob. I'm with you! Look. It's the witch. She's got Scooby in that boat. Let's get her! - Hold on tight. Don't let her go! - Get her! Hold it. Stop. It's me! - Shaggy. - We thought you were the witch. Hey, look. This is an airboat. What's it doing in this half-flooded riverboat? I don't know, but let's borrow it and bust out of here. There's the exit. Zoinks! Look who's guarding it. Help! Help! She got me! - Get her off! - Wait a minute. That's only a sheet painted to look like a witch. - Her head is just a balloon. - That's what made her fly. Swell. Now how about stopping this crazy craft? I can't stop it. The throttle's stuck. I'll stop it. Wow. What a stop. You mean, "What a catch. " Look what the anchor hooked. Yeah. Like, an armored-type car. Wow. Look at all the sacks of money. There must be a million dollars in there. So that's it. Those creeps were after this money. Well then, let's give it to them. Look. The money. Money, money, money! Here, double-ugly. Go buy yourself a new face. Ta-ta! Let's go, Scooby! Is the cart set up? Here they come. - It's all set. - We're ready down here. - Now what'll we do? - When I yell "duck," dive aside. Now we've got you. Duck! Oh, no. Scooby goofed. I'll un-goof him. Got him. And we've got them. Thanks to that fast fishing team of Shaggy and Scooby. Yeah. Scooby-Doo! I gotta hand it to you. Finding that missing armored car after all these years - But who are these two? - Don't you recognize them, sheriff? Why, it's Zeb and Zeke. They hijacked the armored car and sunk it in the swamp. They waited till it was safe to look for it, but couldn't find it. So they invented the witch-and-zombie act to keep people away. While they searched the swamp with the metal-tipped pole. The pole would make a metallic sound when it hit the car. And then they'd pull it up with the winch. They had us fooled for a while with a smokescreen trick. Show them, Velma. Zeke, the witch, could appear and vanish as if by magic behind a cover of smoke. Watch. They sure had everything figured out. But where they're going, their disappearing act will never work. What started out as a fishing trip sure ended in a dandy mystery. - What's Scooby doing? - He's still fishing. Come on, Scoob. Give up. You're not gonna catch anything in that bucket of water. Finally! Lookie, lookie, lookie! That's one fish story no one will believe. Scooby-Doo!
What's that? The ghost of Red Beard! Listen: "Coast Guard baffled as third freighter raided within a week. " "C.L. Magnus, owner of shipping line claims it's the ghost of Red Beard the pirate seeking revenge. " Like, I'm sure glad he's not seeking my superduper sandwich! Yeah! Yeah! Lucky for him. He'd probably get indigestion. Paw please, Scooby. Now, that's what I call handy bite-size! Delicious! What happened? Poor Mr. Magnus! First he's going out of business, now this ghost pirate shows up. Why would a ghost pirate want revenge on a nice man like Mr. Magnus? I don't know. But maybe we can help him solve this mystery. Let's go see him! - This must be the apartment. - "Penthouse, C.L. Magnus. " Yes? Excuse us, but we'd like to talk to Mr. Magnus. I'm afraid not. He's not to be disturbed. Well! That slams the door closed on this ghost mystery! If Mr. Magnus knew we wanted to help, he'd see us. Maybe we still can. I've got an idea. - Is everybody all set? - Okay! Yes? Room service! - Breakfast is served! - At 11:00 at night? Sure, so you don't have to get up in the morning to eat! What's going on in here? Do you believe we're here to help? - Like Good Samaritan Joes! - Yeah, yeah! So, you see, it was over that Red Beard the pirate was the terror of the seven seas. When my ancestors brought him to justice he vowed to return and avenge himself. Now that he has, I'm afraid nothing can be done to stop him. I'm not so sure, Mr. Magnus. Ghosts are our specialty. And I have a plan that I think will work. If Red Beard sticks to a schedule, he should strike tonight! Yeah! And we are going to be there first, and fool him. There's the Magnus freighter, right on schedule. Good. Now keep your eyes peeled for a mysterious fog bank! That's where we'll find Red Beard's ghost! You can stop looking, it's right ahead! - Let's put Operation Decoy to work! - I'll switch on the tape recorder. Now head into the fog bank, Shaggy. Let's hope that ghost thinks we're the freighter! It sure is creepy in here. Like, the fog is so thick, you can cut it with a knife. Scooby-Doo! Wow! Look! The ghost ship! Our plan worked too well! It's going to ram us! - Quick, full-speed reverse! - Like, double full-speed reverse! Start paddling! I'm paddling! But I'm not getting anywhere! - Me, neither! - Hang on! We've been cut in half. - Now what'll we do? - Sink! Oh, my hairdo! Scooby-Doo! Where are you? Hey! Come on, let's get out of this water. And there's only one place to go. The ghost ship! Ghost ship? Oh, boy! One more tug! Well, we're aboard this creaking, creepy craft. Like, let's hope the others made it too. I hope so. Do you see any ghosts? No, this spooky old ship looks deserted to me. If I know Shag and Scoob, they're already aboard. Let's find them. Yeah, and maybe we can find some clues as well. This must be Red Beard's cabin, Scoob. And look at that kooky picture. That must be Red Beard, himself! Yipe! Help! Zoinks! It's him! An unfriendly ghost sword! Zoinks! Yipe! That was close! Yeah! Now, let's figure how to get out of here! One, two, three ghosts! For a ghost ship, there sure aren't many ghosts. Maybe they're haunting for a new house. Or out with a couple of old "ghoul friends. " Our jokes weren't that funny, Freddy! - I didn't laugh! - Look! Red Beard! Come on, let's follow him, but not too close. - He's gone! - Maybe he went in that door. Let's go take a look. Come on! He's not in here, that's for sure. Thank goodness. This ghost ship is giving me chills! It's not the ship that's giving you chills. It's this dry ice. What's dry ice doing on a ghost ship? I don't know, but I think we've found a clue! The door! We're locked in! It's him! Red Beard! Stop your sniveling, or I'll make you walk the plank! What are you gonna do with us, Your Ghostliness? But if you were good for anything, I'd spare you. - We're good cooks! - Huh? Good cooks, eh? Well, get up and fix me some dinner! And remember, it better be good, or Aye, aye, sir! Or Well, the seawater's boiling. I wonder what ghosts like in their stew, Scoob. Chains? Chains! Yeah! Ghosts like chains! And, oh, yeah, some ashes from the stove! - You know, this could be real good! - Yeah, yeah! Now, what else? Cobwebs? Cobwebs! Delightful! Why didn't I think of that? Wow! Now, did we forget anything? Soap! Soap? I hardly use it myself, but why not? I sure hope old Red Beard likes ghost pirate stew! Me too! Ghost pirate stew, eh? You eat it! But we aren't hungry. Eat it! Bubbles? Let's bubble our way out of here! Hey! Stop that! Come on, run! Here comes two of them. And we gotta lose them! And the only way to lose them is to fool them! - First, a paper pirate hat! - Pirate hat? And next, my super Shaggy imitation of Red Beard. They went thattaway! Get going, you swabs! They thought I was Red Beard! Yipes! It's him again! - They'll never find us under here. - I hope! Only trouble is, I can't see where we're going! Going down! Oh, boy, off of one tub and into another. Shaggy! - Scooby, your voice has changed. - Up here! - Velma! - We're locked in! Don't worry, we'll save you, I think. Come on, Scoob! Follow that ghost ship! So this is where they've been hiding! A secret cove at Skull Island. Why does a ghost ship need a secret cove? I don't know. This mystery gets more mysterious by the minute! There they go! Keep paddling, Scooby! Yipes! Keep paddling! Quit clowning around! Soon you shall join my crew! What did he mean by that? I guess he means we're going to be ghosts before he's done! I hate to spoil his fun, but we're gonna bust out of here! But how? The key for the lock is way over there! Like this. A pole from this straw, and gum is going to get us the key! It won't quite reach. One more piece of straw ought to do it. Got it! Let's get out of these creepy caves! You said it! That seagoing spook might show up any minute! - Four tunnels. Which one shall we take? - Mo! - Mo? - Sure! Eenie, meenie, minie, mo! Mo it is! Hi, Velma. Shaggy! Scooby! Hey, Shag, I see you found us! Yeah, now like, let's all get lost! First, get rid of that ridiculous pirate hat you're wearing. Hey! Wait a minute! Let me see that hat! This is a ship's manifest! I've heard of man-o-war, but I've never heard of man-o-fest! It's a list of the cargo the ship was carrying and how much it was worth. Is that a clue? You bet! Look at the date! That ship won't sail until tomorrow! - How would a ghost get this? - Why would he want it? I have a hunch a little investigation will give us the answer. Come on! I was right! Truck tire tracks! Now we know the ghost drives a truck. Let's see where they go. - Okay, Scooby, follow the tire tracks. - Yeah, yeah! Well, lead on. - A pirate's chest! - It must contain the truck because that's where the tracks end. If so, this creepy cave is creepier than I thought! Come on, let's find out what's in the chest. Open it up! What's the password, you swabs? Zoinks! A talking pirate skull! Everybody relax, it's only a mini-microphone and speaker. - What's it mean by "give the password"? - I don't know, let's give it a try. "Sixteen men on a pirate's chest"? Let's see. "Yo-ho-ho, blow the man down"? How about, "Yum, yum, yum, and a liverwurst a la mode"? Wow! What a password! It worked this voice-activated secret entrance! - The tire tracks go right inside! - And so are we. Come on! So this is where Red Beard stores his stolen cargo. And this is where Red Beard will keep his secret forever! Zoinks! It's that goony ghost again! Let's get- Lower the iron door, and after them! Quick! Behind the crates! Zoinks! It's the gay blade of the ghost set again! Yoinks! It's trying to shish kebab us, Scoob! Scooby snacks! Scooby snacks! Boxes of them! - Scooby-Doo! - Scooby-Doo! If I only had a sword! This nightstick should do it! En garde! - Wow! It's liverwurst! - Liverwurst! Delicious! Gangway! Behind that barrel! Down the hatch! I should have known! Oil! Make your shots count. I hope this works on ghosts! Bull's-eye! Two down! I mean up! And one Red Beard to go! Now I'll make a pirate's stew out of you! - Hands up and stand back, partner! - An eggbeater? Yeah, an eggbeater! Hey! Let's ride! He'll never catch us on this automatic pogo stick! Pogo stick? This is a jackhammer! - Shaggy! - Scooby! Look out! Look out! The tires! We did it, Scooby! Scooby-Doo! Nice going, kids. Uncovering these phonies and their ship is a job well done! Thanks. Now, let's see whose glowing phosphorous face Red Beard really is! Mr. Magnus! I thought like, the butler always did it! - But who are the other two? - Hired henchmen, I guess. Mr. Magnus was about to lose his business unless he came up with a lot of money! What easier way than to hijack your ships and sell the cargo? They had a neat ghost setup. Down to the ghost sword operated by wires. Where did that mysterious fog come from? - Simple! Like, dry ice! - Dry ice? Sure. All they did was drop dry ice over the side of the ship. And when dry ice mixes with water, it makes a real spooky fog. - Show them, Scooby. - Right! Scooby-Doo!
- You sure nobody wants a sandwich? - I do. No, thanks. Not one of your jaw-stretcher specials. - Let's see, now, more bologna? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - And some more meat loaf? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. And a slug of double Dutch chocolate syrup. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, swell. We're out of gas. Like, what a creepy place to run out of gas. What are we gonna do? There isn't a gas station for miles. Hey, look. There's a farmhouse. Maybe we can get some gas there. It's worth a try. Come on. - Like, nobody home. - Get off of my property! I'm sick of you reporters pestering me night and day! - Now, get! - Reporters? We're not reporters. No. We just wanna buy some gasoline. Gas, huh? I don't believe you. Now, get on out of here, the lot of you! Excuse me, sir. But why would reporters wanna bother you? They've been running me ragged ever since it showed up. "It"? What's "it"? A ghostly craft from another world moving across the sky like an evil spirit. Evil spirit? You mean, like a haunted flying saucer? Right. But that's not all. Something's been creeping around here ever since it showed up. Then it must have just crept by. Look over there. - Footprints. - Zoinks! I've never seen footprints like those before. I see them all the time. They sure are strange-shaped tracks. - Let's us make tracks the other way. - I'm with you. Hold it. They're gone. Ghostly flying objects strange tracks that glow in the dark And something creepy creeping around in the night. He got me! He got me! He got me! Help! He got me! You big chicken, it was only a chicken. Get down. Those footprints weren't made by a chicken. It looks like we've found ourselves a mystery. Sure was nice of that farmer to give us some gas. Yeah, now we can go look for that ghost craft. Well, you don't have to look any further. There it is. Zoinks! What a creepy-looking crate. We're in luck. It landed behind that hill. Yeah, we're in luck. And, like, it's all bad. It looked like it landed somewhere around here. What is this place, anyway? Looks like it's an old abandoned airfield. Hasn't been used for years. I'm for abandoning it too. It's, like, got the creeps. Do you guys see what I see? It's those spooky glowing tracks again. Oh, no. It's our first clue. Let's follow them. Let's don't and say we did. But the gate's locked. How will we get in? Ghosts! You mean wind. The gate wasn't locked. Come on. Zoinks! What's that? I'll bet it's the outer space ghost. That's it. That's it. I'm staying right here. - Me too. - Okay, if you wanna stay here alone. Hey, wait for us! The tracks go into that old shed. Fine. Now we know, let's go. - What's that funny noise? - Let's go inside. Hold it. - Let's settle for a peek inside. - What do you see? It's Scooby. How did he get in there? Hey, Scooby, I'm glad you're out. - What did you see? - Nothing. - You mean the shed is empty? - The window's too dirty to see through. - Come on. - Look at that. The tracks vanish right at the door. I see something. A generator. And it's still warm. I'll bet you that's what that humming sound was. But who would be running a generator on an abandoned airfield? I don't know. Zoinks! There's that sound again. It's the weirdo spaceship. And it looks like it's coming down close to here. - What'll we do now? - Come on. Let's split up and see if we can find this mysterious ghost from space. Like, wow, we always find the scariest things. But there's no use being scared on an empty stomach. Have a peanut. Take two. They're small. Good. Well, okay, wise guy let's see you try that one again. - Just try it. - Scooby-Doo! Zoinks! The ghost! Hold your breath and don't move a muscle. Pilot to copilot I got an idea. Release the life raft. Right. Well, it wasn't the easiest escape but we lost him. I hope Shaggy and Scooby are having more luck. Shall we look in here? It looks like a shop. Go on in, Freddy. Let's look around. Let's get out of here. It's all greasy. Wait a minute. That's a clue right there. - What do you mean? - This is fresh grease. And these tools have all been used recently. Hey, hold it! Freddy, what's happening? How should I know? Just get me down from here. - But how? - Look for a button or a lever that works the hoist. What would the button look like, Freddy? Velma, surely you can figure it out. Mechanics aren't my cup of tea, Freddy. Well, find Shaggy and Scooby, then, and hurry. I just hope we can find them. I feel like a side of beef. I wonder where Freddy and the girls are. We got to warn them about Ghost Man. Might as well look in here. What's that? Let's get out of here! Shaggy? Ghosts! - Where? - There. - Ghosts! - Where? Ghosts! - Velma, look. - Hey, wait a minute. One of those ghosts has paws. Oh, hi. We were just looking for you two. - We could see that as you ran past us. - You must have scared yourselves silly. - Where's Freddy? - You might say Freddy got hung up. Come on. We've got to hurry back and get him down. Lucky we got you down, Freddy. Like, you might have scared the ghost away. Never mind the jokes. What about this thing you saw? Yes, your description was pretty vague. Well, you might say it looked exactly like that. Zoinks! That's him! Get lost! In a case like this, Shag and Scoob did exactly the right thing. Let's scram. Hold it! Hit the binders! "Mess hall"? Never heard of a special place to make a mess. But it's my kind of place to hide. Come on. Heck, Scooby, this isn't a mess hall. It's a kitchen. And a kitchen means -  food! - Food! And, man, am I starved. But even if we find something, it'll probably be stale and no good. Oh, well, it won't do any harm to look, anyway. Nothing. Find anything, Scoob? Hey, Scoob, did you find anything? So you did find something. - Olive? - One olive? Oh, well, it's better than just a pit. Hey, what's all this? Ham and chicken bones? Scooby, I think you've given us another good clue to this whole mystery. - Clue? - Yeah. Like, how come a ghost from space keeps chicken and ham around? - Right. - Let's go tell the others. Zoinks! It's it again! Let's get! Find a place to hide. Trying to make a clean getaway, huh, Scooby? - Yikes! - Yikes! Gangway! There's another hangar check that didn't give us a single new clue. I wish I knew where Shaggy and Scooby were. They're supposed to be helping us. I wish I knew where that ghost was. Let's keep going. Hold it. There's something in that barrel. A newspaper. But what makes those little dots glow? That's the same kind of a glow as those strange footprints we saw. Hold this like you were reading it, Freddy. How do you like that? Glowing fingerprints. And look at the story that's been circled. "Mysterious ghost craft reported near abandoned air field. " Here's something else. - That's yesterday's newspaper. - I don't get it. Why would a ghost from outer space be reading yesterday's newspaper? I guess we gave that ghost the slip for now. We gotta sneak past Mr. Creepy and find Freddy and the girls. Come on. I said: Not me, him. That's our cue to skidoo. Quick, Scooby, put this key in a safe place. Right. Oh, no, another door. Old Frightening Face won't be able to open the door now. Oh, no. It opened the other way. Yikes! - Quick, Scoob, give me the key. - The key? You threw it out the window? We gotta get that key and get out of here. - There it is. - Got it. Now we can get out of here. I'm getting worried. We haven't seen hide nor long hair of Shaggy or Scooby. I hope they didn't run into that ghost again. Look at the side of that hangar. Whatever it is, there's two of them this time. Don't just stand there. Let's get out of here. - Hey, why are they running? - Look. They got scared of our shadows. That's not you or me, Scooby. Hey, wait for us! Hey, Shaggy, here we are! Boy, we're sure glad to see you guys. What did you find out? We still don't have any clues as to what that ghost craft is that's flying around in the air. Or Old Mr. Creepy who keeps popping up all over the place. Well, it seems to me that our ghost from outer space is using this airfield for something else besides haunting. What's the matter, Scoob? - Gasoline. - There's gas in the exhaust pipe? - In this old relic? - By golly, it's a clue, all right. - This motor's been running recently. - But it couldn't possibly run. It's got four flat tires. Maybe that's what someone wants us to believe. Get a load of this. Like, an extra set of wheels. Instead of getting clearer, this mystery's getting cloudier all the time. Zoinks! A ghost jeep! Look, it's that goony ghost from outer space. Jumping jellybeans! There's a whole army of them. Yeah, and I'm gonna show them a good old Army maneuver. Retreat! Quick, in here. Well, I'll be. Looks like we struck real pay dirt, Scoob. Look at that equipment. And I'll bet you that mike is hooked up to loudspeakers -  on this crazy old airfield. - Wow. We'd better get Freddy and the girls up here on the double. - What is that? - That has to be Scooby. They must've found something up in the tower. Let's go. - I hope we're not too late. Look. - Oh, no. Let's run for it. They got the message. Here comes Freddy and the girls. Look! Here comes Mr. Trouble too. Those chairs won't keep him out of here, Scooby. We'd better think of something else. - Parachute? - Parachute? Only as a last resort. A very last resort. The ghost! We're too late. That ghost has gotten to Shaggy and Scooby first. - Oh, no. - Don't jump! Geronimo! Well, we're glad we found you. What are you doing here, Mr. Farmer? I got worried about you when I saw your car parked by the gate. - That's when I called the sheriff. - I'm glad he did. It's high time we got to the bottom of these shenanigans. Sheriff, look. He's getting away. I think our glowing friend just made a bad mistake. Come on. - He ran in that door. - What is it? Wind tunnel. This ought to be good. Start it up, Freddy. Now take a look at our ghost from outer space. He was wearing rubber boots to make those strange tracks. Dipped in phosphorus, no doubt. You can, like, shut it off, Fred. He's had enough of being a space ghost. Well, I don't believe it. It's Henry Bascomb, my next-door neighbor. But what about those weird noises and the flying thing? Come on, I'll show you. It was a very clever plan. Here's our ghost craft. - Like, home movies. - But what about those odd voices? - It was just a speeded-up soundtrack. - Played over the loudspeaker. But we did see a whole bunch of those creepies over by the motor pool. Wanna bet they're all stuffed dummies? And you wanna bet that crazy jeep was run by remote control? The last remaining puzzle in my mind is, why? I can answer that. This Bascomb fellow got wind that the Air Force was planning to open the field again and would be needing more land for jets. So that's it. He wanted to scare us off so he could pick up the land cheap. And I'd have done it too, if you kids hadn't come along. Weren't you kids scared, like the rest of us? Oh, no. Solving mysteries is our hobby. It takes a lot to scare us. Yikes! Help! Help! Save me! They're back! Those creeps are back again! Help! Scooby-Doo.
Wow. They sure picked a creepy enough place to read a will. And a creepy enough night too! Yeah. You would have to inherit a fortune, Scoob. - Sorry. - Well, it was quite a story. It even made the papers! Yeah, listen to this! "Dog named in inheritance. " "Eccentric millionaire, Colonel Beauregard Sanders leaves one million dollars to four relatives and a dog named Scooby-Doo. " "Scooby-Doo rescued old Beauregard from a fishpond years before, and was remembered in his will! " Well, I wish I'd remembered not to come along! No telling what's waiting for us tonight! Oh, I see you made it. Well, bring the dog and come in. The others are waiting inside. Yes, sir. Attention, everybody. As you all know, I am Cosgood Creeps attorney of the late Colonel Sanders. My partner, Mr. Crawls, couldn't make it tonight. Creeps and Crawls. They sure picked the right lawyers for this job! Colonel Sanders was a bit odd and his only instructions were to play this record for you. Greetings, you all. Cousin Simple, Nephew Norvell sweet Cousin Maldehyde, Cousin Slicker and my old friend, Scooby-Doo. Since you're all here let's get to the nitty-gritty of inheriting my fortune. You're going to receive an equal share of the million dollars providing you spend tonight here in the old family mansion. That shouldn't be hard. The house is haunted! - Haunted? - Yes, haunted. And those of you that don't stay his share of the fortune will go to the others. Now good night and pleasant dreams, you all. Oh, boy! Well, that's it. I will return to the island in the morning to find out which of you remain if any. - Yeah, but into what? - Yeah, what? Relax, Scooby. We'll spend the night with you. Let's hit the sack. First, I'm gonna hit the lunch sack with a Shaggy super-sandwich. And it looks like Scoob is gonna hit the bathtub. Let's see, a little salt and a little pepper and oh, yes, a little fish food! Zoinks! Sorry! Hey, Scoob! Hurry it up, will you? Okay! I thought you were taking a bath! Tub tipped to basement. You mean the tub tipped up and slid into the basement? Yeah! And shadow, spooky. You saw a shadowy, chain-rattling phantom? Yeah! Yeah! You gotta be kidding! Come on, let's take a look at that tub! Well, Scooby, the bathtub looks okay. - And it's bolted down. - You've got some imagination. Yeah. Quit with those scary tales, will you? Let's get some sleep. Oh, boy! Like, what was that? I don't know! But it came from Cousin Simple's room! Poor Cousin Simple. All that's left of him is his nightcap. Isn't that a shame? Get a load of this writing on this mirror! It says: - Signed, the "Phantom Shadow. " - Phantom Shadow? Then you were right, Scooby! I think we better return to our rooms and lock our doors! Fantastic! That dummy looks just like Scooby-Doo. - You think this plan will work? - Sure. I left the door unlocked. When the Phantom Shadow grabs the Scooby dummy, we'll all grab him! All but Shaggy and Scooby. They've decided to play it safe and watch from the drainpipe. I can't think of a safer place. Can you, Scoob? Don't worry! I'll save you! - Velma! - Shaggy! Let me go! I told you I'd save you! Great. But next time, please don't do me any favors! Yeah. No favors. Like, where are we anyhow? It's some sort of old secret passage underneath the mansion. - What is it? - Footprints. The Phantom Shadow must have been this way! That's funny! If he's a phantom shadow -  how come he leaves footprints? - Dirty feet? Well, we'll follow those dirty feet and find that phantom. And you'll lead the way. But what if the Phantom Shadow grabs me? That's the chance I'll have to take. Now be brave and lead the way. Yeah, I gotta be brave. I gotta be brave. I gotta be brave. I gotta- I gotta be some kind of nut! - Gangway! - Oh, no, you don't! You're going to be brave no matter how chicken you are! The footprints go in there. Like, wow! What's all that crazy stuff? Civil War relics! The colonel used to collect them! Let's go see. Uniforms must have been his favorites. The wagon's full of them! Yipes! Zoinks! Haunted uniforms! Zoinks! Cornered in an elevator! Wow! You did it, Scooby! Yeah! I wonder where this eerie, old elevator goes to. Out of here, I hope. Well, what do you know? It goes to Cousin Slicker's room. Come on. But where is Cousin Slicker? Gone! Like Cousin Simple. They're all gone. - Cousin Simple! Cousin Slicker! - Nephew Norvell! Sweet Cousin Maldehyde! All but one. - Me? - Yes, you, Scoob. Oh, boy! Wow! What a night for a fright! Yeah! Four missing heirs, a haunted house and a phantom shadow! Like, all that's missing is a spooky organ. It's not missing anymore. Come on. Let's find out where it's coming from. Well, here's the organ. Yeah, but where's the kook that was playing it? Gone. But he left his music book behind. Hey! Let me see that. There's some writing on the cover. If anyone gets fed around here, it'll be me. Me too. - You can't feed an organ. - But you can play one. I'll play it! I'll play it! Oh, brother. - Watch the floor and see what happens. - We'd better watch the walls! - Why? - Because they're closing in on us! The door's locked! - Quick, Scooby! Do something! - Right! No! Like, keep playing the organ. It might stop those wild walls! It worked! The walls stopped! Let's get out! I don't like playing musical riddles! That's it, Daphne! This is a musical riddle! I've got it. Feed isn't a word. It's musical notes! F- E-E-D. Look! Secret stairs in the floor! Come on, let's see where they go. Creepy, cobweb-filled catacombs. And that's not all. Look! Coffins! Five of them! And the empty one's, like, dog-shaped! Dog-shaped? Zoinks! They're opening! It's them! The cousins! It's the Phantom Shadow! Only he's not a shadow, he's a green ghost! Now there's two of them! He's fainted! - Grab Scooby! - Like, let's get out of here! Scooby! Wake up! Wake up! Come on, Scoob! Will you wake up for a Scooby snack? Here, Scoob. Hurry! Shaggy, stop! Well, it's about time you woke up. Yipe! We fooled that goofy ghost this time. He'll never find us up here. Everywhere we look, Scoob, giggling green ghosts! Look! Look! Hey! A wine rack! Don't fire until you see the green of his eyes. Right! Fire! - Yippee! Hurray! - Hurray! - Let's go, Scooby-Doo! - Scooby-Doo! Hello? It's for you! Faster! They're, like, gaining on us! Yeow! Quick, Scoob! Like, grab your partner! Well, we finally ditched those creepy ghosts. Yeah, but they'll be back. How did you get that green stuff on your hand? Dancing with those green ghosts. How else? That's it! Come on, everybody! To the laundry room! Laundry room? I've seen goofy traps before but this is the goofiest! Not goofy, Shaggy. Simple! We use a fan, soapsuds a spring-loaded ironing board and a washing machine. When the ghosts come through the door, we'll take them to the cleaners. Now let's see how it works. Ready, Scooby? - Ready! - Fan on! Look! It works! Scooby-Doo! Daph, Velma and I will lure the ghosts through the door! - When I yell "Now," switch on the fan. - Right! I'm all set too! - Here they come now! - Now? - Oh, no! Scooby turned it on too soon! - And, like, in reverse yet! - A flying washing machine! - Duck! They went out the door! Look out! They took the elevator down to the tunnel. I can't steer this crazy machine! We'll take the shortcut. Hang on! Got them! Looks like these ghosts are all washed up! There they are, sheriff. Mr. Creeps and his partner, Mr. Crawls. They tried to scare the heirs off the island! Then no one would spend the night and they'd control the fortune. Creeps pretended to be the phantom, and make the house seem haunted. The cousins were scared away. They put look-alike dummies in the coffins. But that plan backfired. So did painting themselves like green ghosts. Where they're going, Creeps and Crawls could use a good lawyer! Here it is. It all belongs to you now, Scooby! One million dollars! Oh, no! Wouldn't you know it! All in Confederate money! How about that? We spend a night of fright for worthless money in a haunted house that wasn't haunted. - Oh, no! Then what's that? - Zoinks! - A floating haunted bone! - Bone? I guess haunted bones are one thing Scooby's not scared of. - Way to go, Scoobs! - Scooby-Doo!
Here we are. Wolf's End Lodge. Like, it even sounds like a wolf. That is a wolf, silly. Wow, what a run-down and creepy place for a weekend of skiing. I know. But it's the only place we could find. Come on. Let's go in. Welcome to Wolf's End Lodge. We have all the comforts of home. Yeah? Whose home? Dracula's? It's cold out there. Excuse me for interrupting but could you put this suitcase in a safe place for me, Mr. Greenway? Certainly. Certainly. Nice doggy. Nice doggy. - Who's that? - That's Mr. Leach, another guest. Now, if you'll be so kind I'll show you to your rooms. This is the young ladies' room. The other rooms are across the hall. Oh, yes, a word of warning: Be sure to lock your doors and windows before you go to sleep. Lock our doors and windows? Why? Because if you don't, the snow ghost will get you and turn you into ghosts. Snow ghost?! - Turn us into ghosts? - Ghosts?! Well, it's time to turn in. Before we go, we'll make sure the windows are locked. I'll check it. It's locked. Zoinks! The snow ghost! Run! We gotta get out of here! Come on! Gangway! That snow ghost is for real, all right. Look at the size of those footprints. Now what will we do, Freddy? Get snow cars and follow those tracks. I wanna find out about our mysterious guest. Oh, boy, this ski trip's turning into a real scare trip. Boy, that snow ghost sure gets around. The tracks end at this chasm. Well, if he tried to walk across, the first step is a doozy. The snow ghost! And he can fly! Duck! There he goes, flying across the sky. - He disappeared behind those trees. - That's where we're going. Come on! - This is where he went. - But no snow ghost. Look. There's a cave with a light coming from it. - Maybe that's where he lives. - There's only one way to find out. - Go see if he's home, Scoob. - Me? You can run the fastest if he's there. - Now, cut that out. - My leg! My leg! Oh, brother! Scoob says the coast is clear. Come on. What a strange cave. Yeah, like, furnished in early Chinatown. This stuff isn't from China, Shaggy. It's from Tibet. It's for sure the snow ghost doesn't live here. Then who does? Maybe if we ring this gong, we'll find out. Who dares enter the temple of Fu Lan Chi? Yipe! I know this sounds silly, but we were following a snow ghost. Yeah. And we thought he might have come in here. I don't think he believes us. I know you speak the truth, for I am the one the snow ghost seeks. - You? - You? Yes. Many years ago in Tibet I came face to face with a beast known as the yeti. I leaped across a gorge to the safety of a narrow ledge. But I had not seen the last of him for his ghost returned to seek revenge. And I was forced to flee for my life. And now, after all these years of hiding he has found me once again. Zoinks! It's the snow ghost! Do not be alarmed. It is only the white timber wolf. - White timber wolf? - Yes. He's my friend. I feed him, and he protects me. - All he wants is his bone. - Bone? This snow ghost is after something besides you. And we're gonna find out what it is. Do you believe that story Mr. Chi told us? Right now, it's the only story we have. Hey, wait a minute. Stop! There's more snow ghost footprints. And look. They're covered with sawdust. Sawdust? Maybe he works in a meat market. Where there's sawdust, there's usually a sawmill. And I'll bet that's where we'll find those footprints came from. Wow. This place looks more like a scare mill than a sawmill. It's probably been deserted for at least 100 years. And I'm for keeping it deserted. Let's go! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Not before we get to the bottom of this mystery. Let's search this place. Come on, you scaredy-cats! Oh, Scooby! That's just your reflection in a broken mirror. Velma? Yipe! Shaggy? Velma?! Shaggy?! Scooby! Help! Velma! Quick, Scooby! Cut the chain! Get a bigger saw! Yipe! Scooby! - Quick, make like a beaver! - Beaver? You did it, Scooby! Scooby-Doo! Yipe! Help! Help! Hey! Give me back my glasses. - Yipe! Dynamite! - Dynamite? After Scooby picked the lock on the chains, we came right back here. Now all we have to do is find Shaggy. It's Shaggy! He's been turned into a ghost by the snow ghost. Shaggy! Shaggy! Hey! Shaggy's not a ghost anymore. - I'm not? - What happened? I don't know. All I remember is fainting at the sight of Mr. Hairy-Scary and waking up as a goony ghost. You must have been sprayed with white stuff. The water washed it off. Wait. If the snow ghost didn't turn you into a ghost -  maybe he's not a ghost, either. - Then he must be for real. Run, everybody! - Like, thanks a lot. - Sorry. Keep running! He's right behind us. Quick! Duck behind those logs. - Well, we lost him. - Yeah, but we lost Daphne too. - I'm in here. - Hey! A secret hollow log. That's not all that's in here. Look. Diamonds! And jewelry! But what are they doing hidden in that log? I'm beginning to figure out this kooky deep-freeze mystery. While you put two and two together, we better find Shaggy and Scoob. Zoinks! That creep never gives up. Scooby, this is no time to be a backseat driver. Hurry! Turn left! Turn right! He's right behind us! Now he's in front of us! - Head for the ice, Scooby! - Ice? Ice! "Dan Dan ger. Danger. Danger. Thin ice. " We're frozen like a couple of icicles. But at least we're safe from that creepy snow ghost. We're on a ski jump! Quick! Make like a bird. Lucky we found you. You would've been stuck till the spring thaw. I'd rather be stuck here than with that snow ghost. Speaking of that snow ghost, what are we gonna do? Catch him. This quick-freeze worked on Shaggy and Scooby. Maybe it'll work on him. Come on! - All set, Scooby? - Yeah, yeah, yeah! Okay. When we lure the ghost past here take the lid off the bucket and dump the water on him. - He'll freeze into a block of ice. - Yeah, yeah, yeah! And just to make sure you don't miss here's a couple of Scooby Snacks. Scooby-Doo! It's the snow ghost! And he's trying to throw Scooby off the ledge! I'll save you, Scoob! - Be careful! - Gangway! Look out! Watch it! Mr. Greenway! Have I got a headache. You kids uncovered one of the biggest rings of jewel thieves in the country. Those two were the masterminds. Leach over here would bring the stolen jewels to Greenway in a suitcase. Greenway sent them across the border hidden in these hollowed-out logs. To scare people away, he disguised himself as the snow ghost. He got the idea when Fu Lan Chi told him that wild story. He even made it look like he could fly. - How did he do that? - Transparent plastic skis. They're almost impossible to see at night. Show him, Scooby. - Hey! - Yay, Scoob! Scooby-Doo! Scooby-Doo! Scooby-Doo!
