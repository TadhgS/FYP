What a nervous night to be walking home from the movies, Scooby-Doo. And all because you had to stay and see Star: Dog Ranger of the North Woods twice. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! - What's that? - It's coming from the bushes. Go see what it is, Scooby. - Don't worry, I'm right behind you. - Thanks a lot. Oh, well. Scooby, come back! Wait! Where he go? Where he go? - Like, next time, signal. - Sorry. Hey, what's that? Looks like a deserted-type pickup truck. Anyone home? You're right, Shaggy. This sure is strange. Yeah. What's an empty, old suit of armor doing in the driver's seat of this pickup? Maybe he went out for the knight. Get it? - Very funny. - Gosh I wonder who this creepy hunk of tin belongs to. Well, the name on the crate says, "Jameson Hyde White Professor of Archeology. London, England. " - Hyde White? - I've heard of hide-and-seek before but I've never heard of Hyde White. That's an English name, you comedians. Hey, what's this? It's a delivery label that says: "Deliver to the County Museum. " So that's where the old knight was headed for. That's using the old noodle. But, like, what happened to our mysterious professor? Well, if he was driving this truck, he's disappeared. Well, gang, it looks like we're up to our armor plates in another mystery. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. I suppose I should thank you for finding the Black Knight. But with Professor Hyde White's mysterious disappearance and all I wish you hadn't. - Why is that, Mr. Wickles? - Because of the legend. - Legend? - Yes. The Black Knight is supposed to come alive when the moon is full. Like, wow! The moon was full last night. Then what was the professor doing with tall, tin, dark and creepy? He was delivering it to the museum. All the way from England. - Where do you want it, Mr. Wickles? - Just put it in the Medieval Room. Right. What's this? Scooby-Doo, where are you? - Come on, Scooby. We're leaving. - Coming. This mystery's got me baffled. Well, it's got me, like, hungry. When do we eat? - Let's eat! - Hey, what's Scooby wearing? They look like some crazy kind of glasses. - He must've found them at the museum. - Yeah, yeah. Man, I wonder what kind of groovy things you see with those. Well, there's one way to find out. Here it is! They're a special type of magnifying glasses used by jewelers, scientists and archeologists. And hold on to your Hula-Hoops. It says here, "made only in England. " - Archeologists? - England? Professor Hyde White! That settles it. There's something fishy going on in that museum. - Museum? - Right, Scooby. Tonight we're going fishing. This place is locked up tighter than a drum. Then, like, how do we get in? Easy. Shaggy goes through that window up there. - Why me? - Because that's a small window -  and you're the thinnest. - Oh, boy. Come on, give me a hand with this ladder. - It won't reach. - I guess we don't get in. Well, if we don't, we'll never find out what happened to the missing professor. Shaggy, you start up, and I'll get the jack out of the Mystery Machine. Right. - Hang on, Shaggy. - Like, right, man. I'll start cranking. And I'll keep hanging on. - That's it, no more jack. - He still can't reach it. Don't worry. Shaggy's the swingingest gymnast in school. When you get in, open the back door. Right. Watch me swing right in. Well, at least we know he's inside. The Black Knight. Sure glad it's empty. Golly, this place sure is creepy at night. It's even creepy during the day. I think we'd better split up. Daphne and I will go this way you two go that way. And, Scooby, stand guard. Would you do it for a Scooby Snack? - Two? - Okay, two it is. Scooby-Doo! Yikes! - I think we're being followed. - Yeah, by Scooby. All right, Scooby-Doo, you can come with us. All right, all right. Down, down. What did you do that for? You know how that full moon turns on that Black Knight. - That's only a superstitious legend. - Well, I'm not taking any chances. I'm with you. Oh, no, we lost Shaggy. I hope we find Shaggy soon. Stop that noise. I've got it! That's better. Come on. What a spooky place. Not now, Scooby. Not now. Now, look what that dog did. He knows I can't see without my glasses. There you are, Shaggy. You sound terrible. I told you to take care of that cold. Lucky I brought your medicine. I can't find that Velma nowheres. Zoinks! This will fix you up in a jiffy. Let's get out of here! See? You sound better already. Scooby-Doo! Scooby-Dooby-Doo! Sorry! Bye-bye! I tell you, the Black Knight is alive and roaming through the hallways. If we could only find a clue. It's Scooby! When Velma said, "clue," she didn't mean you, Scooby. Hey, like, wait a minute. There's a picture missing from the wall. Maybe that's a clue. - We better tell the others. - Right! It's right down here. - There's no picture missing, Shaggy. - Well, it was a minute ago. Some clue. Well, if that's blood that's a clue. It's paint. And look. A trail of it leads down the hallway. Come on, follow that paint. The trail of paint ends here at the mummy case. Come on, Shaggy. Help me open it. Don't like surprises, especially spooky ones. Oh, come on. Hey, look, a secret room. Somebody sure is a messy housekeeper. And look at that. There are two paintings exactly alike. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Right, Velma. This just about solves the mystery. - It does? - What? No time to explain now, Shaggy. We gotta get the sheriff. Let's take this back way out. Leave it to Daphne to pick the wrong door. Zoinks! Scooby, like, do something. Maybe my ventriloquism bit can get us out of this jam. If I can throw my voice to make it sound like it's coming from the room he might leave. Help! Let me out of this pot! - Help! - Help! Scooby-Doo! Zoinks! Scooby! Yikes! Scooby-Doo! We did it, Scooby-Doo. We did it. We did? Scooby-Doo! - Just as we thought! - It's the curator, Mr. Wickles. We've gotta hand it to you kids. We never would have suspected Wickles as the art swindler. Boy, it was a neat setup. He and his gang were switching fake pieces of art for the real ones in the museum. They made the fakes at night, in a secret workshop behind the mummy case. That's why they had to get rid of the professor. He was the only one who could have spotted the fakes. Oh, my gosh! Professor Hyde White! We never found him. - It's Scooby-Doo with a shoe. - Follow me! See? Professor Hyde White! All the time, it was Wickles who made that Black Knight come to life. - Then there was no legend. - Positively not. Wickles just used the story to cover up my mysterious disappearance. Somehow, he managed to get into the armor, down at the train station. And, like, on the way to the museum, he made you disappear. Zoinks! He's alive! Scooby-Doo!
Here it is, gang. Rocky Point Beach. What a groovy spot for a beach party. Yeah, man. I can already taste those chocolate-covered hot dogs. Yuck! His stomach must be made of scrap iron. Can I help it if my first toy was a garbage disposal? Come on, gang. Let's unload. All right. Okay. I'll give Daphne the boxes. Hurry up! Hey, like, where's Scooby-Doo? He's supposed to be helping me. He went surfing. Scooby-Doo! Okay! Come and get it! Oh, no! Hey, what's with Scooby-Doo? Zoinks! A seagoing ghost! Shaggy, come back! Shaggy, come out of that umbrella. No. Did you see what I saw? Yeah, we saw it and we're going back to find out what it was. Swell. I'll wait here. And when you find out, send me a telegram. We won't have to. Look! It's gone! There's something mighty spooky going on around here. Yeah, and I wonder what it is. Hey, gang, listen to this. "Another Boat Mysteriously Vanishes. Sheriff and Coast Guard are baffled by the mysterious disappearances. " "Beach hermit Ebenezer Shark claims it was the ghost of Captain Cutler who stole it. " - Ghost? - Ghost? Do you think that's what we saw last night? I don't know, but maybe that beach hermit Ebenezer Shark can give us a clue. Then let's pay him a visit tonight. Aye! I seen him with me very own eyes. A ghostly glow moving through the fog just before the boats vanish. But what makes you think it was the ghost of Captain Cutler? Because it was on a foggy night such as this that Captain Cutler's boat was wrecked. It collided with one of them fancy yachts from the marina sending Cutler down to the graveyard of ships. But before he disappeared into the sea he shouted that he would return. So by causing the yachts to vanish from the marina -  Cutler's getting his revenge. - Aye. Hey, it's Scooby! Come on! Zoinks! It's that ghost again! That's no ghost! It's just Scooby-Doo! It looks like your pooch found me old diving suit. Diving suit? Aye. Now, if you want to know any more about Cutler I think you'd better see his wife up at the old lighthouse. There's something mighty fishy about Ebenezer Shark. I'll say there is. Yeah. He looks more like a barracuda. Listen, Daph and I will stick around here and keep an eye on old Shark. You three go up to the old lighthouse and talk to Widow Cutler. - Old lighthouse? - Yeah, old lighthouse. What a creepy-looking lighthouse. Okay, Scooby. Go knock on the door. Right. Look at him. What a ham. I guess it's up to you, Velma. It's up to all of us. Now, march! Ladies first. Well, come on! Wow! Like, this place is furnished in early Halloween. It's obvious. She practices witchcraft. Hey, look at these. What zoinky labels. "Ear of a newt"? That? Oh, that's canned hyena laughs. Look. Witchcraft Made Easy. Very interesting. Velma, who do I know with long, skinny hands? Good evening. Zoinks! Mrs. Cutler, I presume? Aye. I was just tending the light and didn't hear you knock. Now, what's your problem? It's about Captain Cutler. We think we saw his ghost. You did, dearie. It was me and my witchcraft that brought Captain Cutler back from his watery grave. Then it's his ghost that's making these yachts vanish? Aye. But had I known he'd take his revenge I'd have left him under the sea. That's good! You'll pardon me doing the wash, dearie. Well, we have to go now. Thanks for your help. Anytime, dearie. Anytime. Am I glad to get out of that scary pad. Me too. Yuck! Now, our next step is to find the ghost. I think he's found us. Look! Come on! After that glow! It's in that drainpipe. Well, it got away, so let's go. Come here! Scooby will go in after it. Oh, that's different. Me? Yes, you. You're the only one that can squeeze into that drainpipe. Too fat. Too fat? Would you squeeze in for a Scooby Snack? Scooby-Doo! Like, wow! Glowing seaweed! It looks like you found a clue, Scooby-Doo. Well, Scooby-Dooby-Doo! Did you find anything? Here it is. Phosphorum pyrifora. Like, speak English. A phosphorus-glowing seaweed found only in the area known as the "graveyard of ships. " That's where Captain Cutler went down. Then maybe that's where we'll find his ghost and the answer to our mystery. But what about Ebenezer Shark? I don't know, but he headed for the marina about an hour ago. I wonder what he's up to. There it is. The graveyard of ships. I don't like it. Hey, look. A bottle. And there's a note inside. Well, what does it say? No deposit, no return. Big help. We're getting close. Keep a sharp lookout for anything suspicious. Look! One of the yachts from the marina! Hey, there's no one aboard and the motor's not running. Then, like, what's making it go? Ghost power. I was afraid you'd say that. Come on. Let's follow it. It's going into that cove, and there's no way out. Hey, something's wrong. It's gone! Vanished into thin air! It's, like, weirdo! Well, like I always say: "Onward and downward. " To the graveyard of ships, that is. We're all set. Except for Scooby. Oh, come down from there! Scooby, there's nothing to be afraid of. I'll get him down. Howdy do! Howdy do, yourself! Help! Like, wow! What a spooky place. It's a perfect home for that seagoing ghost. Well, if we're going to find any ghosts, we'd better split up. You guys go that way and we'll go this way. Okay. Look! What's that? Could that be Captain Cutler? It could be, but there's only one way to find out. Let's go. Well, is it him? No. Look at that old-fashioned diving suit. He's been down here a hundred years. The door! We're trapped! Hey, Shaggy, look. Scuba tanks. Scooby-Doo? Scooby-Doo, where are you? Hey, Shaggy? I found a clue! I found a clue! You found a clue? This cannon is loaded. There's a fuse in it. Fire! Like, no fire. I forgot matches don't light underwater. Hold still, Scooby! I am! Hey, scram! Shoo! Go! Nice going! We thought we'd never get out of this creepy cabin. Well, like, we never thought we'd lose that ghost. Then you saw him too? He's the one that locked us in. So we haven't had a chance to find any clues. I found a clue! I found a clue! You? You found a clue? Follow me. It's a secret storehouse of scuba tanks. Yeah, and all ready to use. Things are beginning to add up. You mean like two and two are five? More than that. I'd like to get a close look at that ghost. How can we? He's gone. But his trail's not. Look. Glowing footprints. Now all we gotta do is follow them. The footprints vanish right into the side of the cliff. Well, if my sense of direction is right this is the same area where that yacht from the marina vanished. Now what do we do? Like, rest. I'm pooped. Hey! I'm sinking! Look! A secret passage! You're right! Shaggy, you're a genius! - I am? - Sure. Who else but you could've sat down on the rock that opened the secret passage? I thought that rock was pretty suspicious. Come on, gang. Let's go inside. We're in a giant underground cavern! Man! Lookie there! Like, get a load of those yachts. Yeah, and they're being painted over in different colors. Hey, look at that yacht. It's the one that vanished in the cove. And look! It's tied to a minisub. It's just as we suspected and these clues prove it. Then I guess this wraps up our mystery. That is, if we can wrap up the ghost. Not wrap him up, Shaggy, suds him up. Hurry up, Fred. No telling when "glowing gruesome" will show up. I'm ready with the fire hose. Okay, everybody? I hope your contraption works. It's a cinch. We put a bar of soap in this spray container. Attach it to this fire hose turn on the water, and instant suds. And see that ramp? The ghost comes down it, we suds it up, he slips and we hose him right over into that net. Then we hoist him high as a Christmas goose. Okay, gang. Start Operation Noisemaker. Here he comes. Let him have it! Scooby! He can't see where he's going! Scooby, are you all right? Now, let's see if our mystery ghost diver is really Ebenezer Shark. - It's not him. - Then who is it? I got it! Does this seaweed help remind you of that picture on Widow Cutler's wall? Captain Cutler! Hey, listen to this, gang. "Teenage Sleuths Solve Boat Hijacking Mystery. Captain Cutler and his wife taken into custody by sheriff. " That was some plan they had. First, spreading the phony story about Cutler and then stealing the yachts from the marina. That night on the beach, Cutler was storing extra scuba tanks in the graveyard of ships. Yeah, but, like, his diving suit got covered with that kooky glowing seaweed. That's where the glowing ghost story came from. Well, that closes the mystery. How did Scooby do that? I guess that's another mystery.
You sure picked a spooky day to go boating, Freddy. It didn't start out that way. What could have happened? It's very simple. When the barometric pressure dropped and warm air came in contact with an inland cold front we ran into some unnavigable nubilation. You're right, Velma, whatever you said. - I said, we're lost in a fog. - You buzzed? No, Shaggy. Go back to sleep. Sleep, nothing. I'm fixing me a super Shaggy sandwich. Like, wow, my favorite: A double-triple-decker sardine and marshmallow-fudge sandwich. Open the mouth, between the gums. Look out, stomach. Here it comes. Well, at least you left me the olive. With him around, I can't even get a bite in edgewise. - Now what happened? - Looks like we've run aground. - Yeah, but, like, where? - Well, if I'm not mistaken it looks like we're stuck on Haunted Isle. I'm sorry I asked. The old Vasquez Castle's on this island. Maybe we can find help there. - This sure is a creepy place. - Yeah, a regular gruesome camp. Like, what's with Scooby-Doo? Hey, if you wanna play in the sand, Scooby, leave us out of it, huh? Hey, what's this? It's a torn piece of map. D- A-N-G-E-R. Danger? Hey! Look, it's, like, a message! It says, "Danger. Leave Haunted Isle. " It sure looks like someone is trying to scare us off this island. But who? And why? I don't know, but it looks like we found ourselves a mystery and maybe we'll find the answer at that castle. - Come on, let's go! - Oh, boy! Well, here it is. Old Vasquez Castle. Man, what a pad for a scare-in. The place looks deserted. That's Vasquez, the pirate. He sailed the seas in 1612. He must have used this old castle for a hideout. Come on. Let's take a look around. Man, like, plenty spooky! I once read these old castles were loaded with traps. Oh, Velma, don't be silly. That only happens in movies! - Daphne! Daphne! - What happened? Daphne fell through a trap door! Come on. We gotta find Daphne. But what about that: It was probably just the wind. That's the first wind I heard with a sense of humor. - Come on, put your nose to work. - Right. Let me out of here! Let me out of here! Wow! I wonder how I get out of this creepy inner sanctum. Well, my intuition tells me that way. Stop that whistling. You make me nervous. Like, which way did they go? - They went thattaway. - Oh, thanks, man. It's all right. - Like, wow! A talking skull. - Like, wow! I'm so scared. I wish I had a ham sandwich to calm my nerves. Well, what do you know, a ham sandwich! Wouldn't you know, it needs some mustard. This has gotta be my imagination. Otherwise, I'd be scared. Now, maybe my imagination can, like, cut it in half. Someone's coming. Shaggy! Hi, Daphne. Hey, look. Shaggy found Daphne. For once, he used his head. - Are you all right? - Yeah. Just as soon as I have six or seven sandwiches. He's all right, all right. There goes that crazy wind again. Crazy wind, nothing. Look! I warn you. Leave Haunted Isle and never return. The phantom has spoken. Grab that phantom! Did you see that? Yeah! Like, he went through the wall, nonstop. - There's a logical explanation for this. - Quick, tell me. - The place is haunted. - Thanks a lot. Why don't we take that phantom man's advice and clear out of this place? No, Shag. We're not going. - Like, why not? - Three good reasons, Shaggy. First, no phantom's gonna scare us away. Second, why does he want us off this island so bad? - And third, we're marooned. - I'll buy that last one. Hey, fellas, over here. A clue. I found a key in this chest. It must belong to the phantom. Hey, there's some writing on it. It says, "Second passage of the old bell. " - Second passage? - Old bell? There's no old bell in this castle. I've got it. "Passage" must mean a passage in a book. Then The Old Bell must be the name of a book! That's right. And the best place to find a book is in the library. Right. Come on! This is the book called The Old Bell. Look, in the second passage, the word "catacombs" is underlined in red. If my knowledge is correct, we should find catacombs in the basement. This is the place. Okay, Scooby. Go in and take a look around. We'll keep watch out here. No, I'm not kidding. There he goes with his fake-wounded routine. What a ham. Would you do it for a Scooby Snack? How about two? - Three? - Okay, three. Scooby says it's okay. Man, look at all that crazy magic stuff. A saw-them-in-two box, disappearing cabinets, levitating tables. Gosh! But what's all this magic stuff doing here? I think I'm beginning to figure it out. Somebody's coming! Quick! Into the closet! Hurry! Whoever it was must've gone away. Look! The phantom! I warned you to leave the island! Now you will pay! I'll pay! I'll pay! How about 4 bits? Not that kind of pay. Let's get out of here! Help! Help! - Shaggy! - Help! Shaggy! Hey, this is just a dummy head! Someone mention me? - Hey, look! - A magic carpet! I hope this trick works. Ali, go oop. Wait for me! - Well, we've lost him. - Groovy. - Now we gotta catch him. - Not groovy. If we're ever gonna solve this mystery - But how? - Simple, and with just a few things. That suit of armor and crossbow that cannonball and old spring I gotta hand it to you, Fred. You really know how to build a better mousetrap. In this case, a better phantom trap. But what good is it? We can't catch a phantom. I have a hunch that we can, right, Velma? Check, but first we'll have to find him and lure him here. - But how do we find the phantom? - We don't. Scooby does. Scooby does? Right. With your super-sleuth nose, you'll be able to sniff him out. Well, look at him. My nose. Cold in my nose. Cut it out. You don't have a cold in your nose. How do we know the phantom will chase Scooby-Doo? - He's a dog. - Don't worry. We'll soon fix that. Come on, Scooby. Be brave. Just think of Rin Din Din. Lassie. John Wayne. John Wayne? - John Wayne? - Sure, Scooby. Scooby-Doo! Like I said before, what a ham. Phantom! Phantom! Not here. You cannot escape me. Get ready! Here they come! Jump, Scooby! Oh, no! Scooby tripped into our trap. Now you will not escape me. - We caught the phantom! - Thanks to Scooby-Doo! When the fog lifted, we spotted your beached boat and decided to investigate. - But who is that? - This? This is the end of the mystery. Well, if it isn't our old friend Bluestone the Great -  an ex-magician wanted in six states. - But what is he doing here? He must have heard the legend of the Vasquez treasure. Everybody's after it. I get it. He used his magic tricks to keep people away from the island -  while he searched for it. - When he saw us -  he tried to scare us away. - Well, his scaring days are over. He's going to do a final disappearing act courtesy of the local jail. There's one more thing. We figured out all those floating tricks. - Look, no hands! - See? Wires. But how did you walk right through a solid wall? One of my best acts. Let me give one last performance. Hold this rope. It was merely an illusion done with trick mirrors and a special projector. I could cast my image anywhere I wanted and by stepping away from the mirror, it appears that I walk through walls. I must admit, Mr. Bluestone you're a good magician, but a bad phantom. Man, I wonder if, like, there really is a treasure. That's Scooby barking. Come on! - Look! Scooby found something. - Maybe it's the treasure. Well, Scooby-dee-Doo.
Are you sure we took the right turn, Shaggy? Sure. We took this road and turned to the right. No wonder we're lost. You've been reading the map upside down. Here's where we are. At Gold City, the old ghost town. - Ghost town? - Ghost town? What will we do now? What's that over there? "Gold City Guest Ranch. Vacancy. " Maybe we can spend the night there. - There? - Yes, there. Go ahead. Ring the bell, Shaggy. Ring-a-ding-ding, coming up. Welcome, kids. Come on in. I'm Big Ben, owner of this guest ranch. Do you happen to have any rooms? Do I? You're my only guests. Come on in and register and I'll call old Hank. Hank. Oh, Hank. We have some guests. Hey, Scooby, come here. Now, this is Hank, the caretaker here at the ranch. Pleased to meet you. Hank, show the guests to their rooms, like a good feller. Follow me. That will be the girls' room and you fellers can bunk in this one, just across the hall. These sure are nice rooms. I can't understand why the place is empty. It's the miner. - The miner? - The who? The Miner Forty-Niner. - Forty-Niner? - Yes siree. He came to Gold City in 1849 and he can't rest until he finds the last vein of gold. Like, wow, that's what I call an ancient miner. That's for sure. And at night, you can hear the mine moaning calling for the miner. But what has he got to do with the ranch? I don't know but lately, he's been coming up here and scaring the guests away. And I'm going away in the morning myself. Man, that's the wildest tale I ever heard. Ridiculous. A 100-year-old miner. Still, something must have scared off the guests. Gone! Well, it's still early. Why don't we go into the ghost town and take a look around? Wonder what it's like on a Saturday night. Boy, what a spooky old street. I've seen enough. Let's go back. Not until we walk around this ghost town and see what we can find. Like, I know what we'll find. - What? - Ghosts. Hey, look, Shaggy. A real old-time Western saloon. When you said old, you just weren't, like, kidding. - Sarsaparilla, bartender. - Two. No wonder this place is empty. You ask for a sarsaparilla, and all you get is a glass of spider webs. Spider webs? - Zoinks, ghosts! - Ghosts? It's not a ghost. It's a player piano. So who's playing it? It's automatic. It must've turned itself on automatically. Now, come down out of those draperies. Like, why couldn't you have been a poodle? Did you find any clues? - Not a one. - Neither did I. Let's take a look in this old hotel. Maybe our mysterious miner rented a room for the night. - Oh, go on in, Scooby. - Yikes! What a creaky, creepy place. Hey, Scooby, come on. Oh, wait for me. It's lucky for you the room's empty. Let's get back to the others. He's got me! Help! It's only a tree branch. I knew it all the time. The only place we haven't looked is the old mine. And that's all boarded up. I'm beginning to think there really isn't an ancient miner. Well, let's keep moving. Keep together, now. Zoinks! The miner's chasing Scooby! Some miner. It's only a cigar-store Indian. Oh, Scooby. Quit clowning. Who's clowning? Look. It's hollow. Hey, what's this inside? It looks like a map of Gold City. And look how new it is. What's a new map like that doing in an old Indian like this? It's quite simple. - Somebody was hiding it. - Maybe these numbers mean something. Left 10, right 7, left 4, right 23. Maybe it's directions to a buried treasure. Yeah. Like a fortune in buried chocolate cheeseburgers. But those directions don't make sense. - Then they must mean something. - But what? I've got it. I bet it's the combination of a safe. And there's an old safe in the lobby of this hotel. Shaggy, you work on the combination as I read off the numbers. Okay, but I need a moment to warm up. Now, I must have absolute quiet while I work. - Oh, Shaggy. Shaggy. - Quiet. Look, I have the combination. Just turn the knob to the right. Well, why didn't you say so? It's open. Stop showing off, Scooby. I knew it was open all the time. - Like, wow. Get a load of that. - A secret elevator. Well, let's see where it goes. All aboard. Come on, Scooby. Come on, Scooby. You're not chicken. Would you come with us for a Scooby snack? - Two? - Okay. Two it is. Well, come on. Scooby-Doo. Down. Wow. Look where we've landed. A mine tunnel. It must be the old Gold City Mine. Well, if there is a miner, this is where we'll find him. Come on. It's sure dark in here. We could use some light. Hey, I found some candles. Shaggy, that's dynamite! Dynamite? That's strange. This end of the mine's lit by lanterns. Yeah, and I wonder who lit them. Zoinks. You had to ask. That must be the moan that Hank was talking about. I think we better split up and try and find where that moan came from. I'll go with Daphne and Velma. - You go with Scooby-Doo. - Thanks a lot. And, Shaggy, if you find anything, holler. I'm liable to holler even if I don't find anything. Yipe! What are you trying to do, Scooby? Well, quit the clowning and come on. Look at all these doors. Look in one of those, I'll look in this one. Right. You gotta be kidding. I suppose you want me to look. Yep, yep, yep, yep. That's what I was afraid of. - It's empty. - Huh? Empty? What are you trying to do, scare me again? What now? Boy, what a scaredy-dog. You still think there's something in that closet? Okay. We'll switch. You look in this door, and I'll look in that one. And there better be something in it. Oh, no! Zoinks! It's the Miner Forty-Niner! This must be a storeroom. Careful. Those old floors look weak. I know. I know. Look out! Are you all right? Say something. I'm all right, just covered with flour. You wait up there. I'll be right up. We gotta, like, find a place to hide. Quick, in here. Zoinks! A ghost. Let's get out of here. We finally got away from that goony miner. It's him! Look out! Are you guys all right? Groovy. Hey, what happened to Daphne? I fell down in here. Wouldn't you know it? Danger-prone Daphne fell into a mineshaft. - I'll get her. - You'll get her? It's the Miner Forty-Niner. Hey, gang. There's a maze of secret passages down there. And guess what I saw in that mine. Yeah. We saw him too. I guess Hank wasn't kidding about that ancient miner. Do you suppose that's the miner moaning? Well, like, if I had a face like that, I'd moan too. Hey, look. I found a clue. It seems that this wire leads up to that speaker. Now things are beginning to make a little sense. And I have a hunch what we'll find at the other end of this wire. I was right. A tape recorder. Well, that accounts for the mysterious moaning. Hey, look what I found. Like, jars of chocolate syrup. Chocolate syrup, nothing. That's samples of crude oil. Oil? In a gold mine? Hey, this mystery is really getting mysterious. And what about our mysterious miner? I've got a hunch he'll show up soon. Let's borrow this microphone. And, Shaggy, we'll need you too. Listen to that Shaggy go. And Scooby's great at being a train. Got him. Oh, no. Scooby can't stop. Scooby went right through the shack. - He's caught him. - I hope. Hey, that's gotta be the miner. But where's Scooby? Help! Look, stilts. Shaggy's right. He is wearing stilts. Then this can only be one person. - Hank. - Hank? Oh, dagnabit. So it was old Hank who was scaring off my guests. To force you out of business. That way, he could buy the guest ranch, the ghost town- And, like, the mine for almost nothing. Then there must still be gold in that old mine. Not gold. Black gold. - You mean oil? - Like, right. But how did Hank know about the oil? He accidentally found the secret mine entrance in the old hotel safe. And instead of gold, he found oil. He had the exact location laid out on a map. Then he, like, hid the map in the cigar-store Indian for safekeeping. Too bad. We could have been partners. Now, instead of being rich, he's in jail. Hey, like, what happened to Scooby? There he is. Scooby, look out for that gopher hole. Scooby-Doo! One of those apples better be for me.
Oh, boy! Hello. Help! Help! Stop! Stop! Come back here! Help! My princess has been dognapped! Dognapped? - That sounds like Scooby-Doo. - He's sure in a hurry. Scooby-Doo, what's with you? Here's a bulletin just in. Flash! The dognappers have struck again. The third prize dog kidnapped in the last three days. Wow! Like, a canine crime wave! Here's another bulletin. Buck Masters, the owner of the first dog stolen has just offered a $500 reward. Gang, we've just been handed our next mystery. - And, we'll begin with Mr. Buck Masters. - Yeah, yeah, yeah! That's right. I've decided not to pay the ransom. I'd rather use the money to catch those crooks. I was sure to win first prize at the county dog show this year. Now Bob Miller's Great Dane is a shoo-in. - Great Dane? - Did you say Great Dane? Yes. Bob's been grooming his dog for this show all year. But if that's the case, isn't the Great Dane in danger? - He could be dognapped. - Don't worry. I warned Bob. And he only takes the dog out for exercise at night and then only on Beach Boulevard near the police station. It seems safe enough there. From now on, all dog owners must be on their guard. Mr. Masters, we're gonna find out who's stealing those dogs and why. Yep. Dognappers, beware. Frankly, I don't see what you kids can do. I don't have a lead to give you. That's all right, Mr. Masters. We have a plan. We do? See this picture of the champion? This will help a lot. Come on, Freddy. Tell us, like, what's the plan? - Yeah. - Simple. We'll give the dognappers a decoy. And then when they grab the decoy, we'll trail them to their hideout. - But what if we lose the dognappers? - Not a chance. We'll plant this tiny transmitter in the decoy's collar. Our direction finder will do the rest. Yeah, but who's the decoy? Scooby-Doo? Scooby's got a point there. Who'd dognap Scooby for ransom? We'll fix that, and Scooby will be brave. Won't you, Scooby? Now, here's a Scooby snack for courage. Shaggy, why'd you do that? Because I know who's stuck with the job of taking the decoy on a leash. Not bad. Not bad at all. Now here's a snack for you, Scooby. Okay, the decoys are fed. Now let's get down to work. What are we doing, solving mysteries or running a beauty parlor for pooches? Hold it, Scooby. Wait till I get your new collar on. Now, how do you like that? Well, Bob Miller said we could take his place tonight, Scooby. - So come on, champ, let's walk. - Scooby-Doo! Hey, take it easy. Slow down! Come on, Scooby. You're a decoy, remember? Keep your mind on your work. Sorry. Now, cut that out. Keep going. Keep going. Boy! At least you don't have to take another bath. Lucky for you, I'm a dog lover. Wow! Look at that truck smoke! No! No! No! Scooby! They got him! Help! Help! Help! I'm coming, Scooby! I'm coming! I'll never catch him this way. Charlie! Charlie! You got any wheels I can borrow? This is an emergency! Just my motor scooter. Thanks, man! Well, this is Beach Boulevard. But no sign of Shaggy and Scooby. That transmitter on Scooby's collar is moving awfully fast. The dognappers must have Scooby. Okay, this is it. Here we go! Help! Help! Oh, no! Man! It's Geronimo! - I got him, boss. - So you got Miller's Great Dane. Good work, Mike. Let's have a look. You fool! That's not Bob Miller's champion Great Dane! How could you mistake this mutt for a show dog? Gee, boss. He was right where you said he'd be. Get this phony decoy out of here! But what will I do with him? Give him a ride down the mountain on the old handcar. By the time it stops, he'll be 20 miles away. - Come on. Back in the crate. - No! No! And when this weirdo Indian attacked I felt like a late-show rerun of Custer's last stand. Are you sure it was a real Indian? Real? Why, when he waved that tomahawk, even my hair was scared. Well, no hoof prints in the road, but here's something I found. It's an authentic Indian relic, at least 1000 years old. I told you I thought he looked kind of ghostly. Hold it, gang. The transmitter on Scooby's collar is moving again. And it looks like it's heading for Indian Gap. Let's plot an intercept course. Oh, no! Poor Scooby! As a decoy, you're a dud. Well, so long, pooch. Enjoy the ride. Hey! That was Scooby! Hey, Scooby-Doo! Hang on, Scooby! We'll save you! Hurry, Freddy! Give her the gas! One for the money, two for the show three to get ready, and here I go! We're on a trestle. Boy, was that close! As soon as we slow down, Scooby, I'll get you out of that crate. What's that? Sounds like the midnight express. It is! I hope this is the brake! It's rusty. It's not holding. I'll help! I'll help! Watch it! - Faster! Faster! - I'm going faster! - Here they come! - That train is awfully close! There was a switch by the crossroad. Come on! Let's go! Scooby, you're a brave decoy. Did those old dognappers hurt you, Scooby? This is all very nice, but it doesn't solve the mystery. Scooby, can you tell us where the dognappers took you? Yeah! Yeah! Oh, no! Not the Indian! Not the ghost of Geronimo! Yeah! Yeah! Geronimo! Well, we've only got one lead. And that's to backtrack to that old railroad spur. Everybody game? We can get along without the sound effect, thank you. - Geronimo! - Geronimo! Stop the car! Stop the car! Head for the rocks. - He's gone. - Let's get back to the handcar. This is real, like in the movies. I told you that Indian was for real. Well, this arrow isn't for real. It's factory-made. Then how about that? Is that for real? Looks deserted, but somebody's up there. - Nobody's getting my beautiful hair. - Me either. Gang, we've got to get up to that Indian village. And I think I know how we can do it. Now, we're all ready. This giant slingshot will shoot the arrow up to the village taking the rope with it. Then everybody climbs up, okay? Okay, it's solid. Now, let's get up to that village. - Not me. - Scooby, you come back here. Man, this is spooksville. - Like, Indian-style. - Yeah. Spooksville. Okay, gang. Let's explore. - What's that? - Look! Up there! Leave this place, paleface intruders or suffer fate of Spanish conquistadores buried in desert below! That's him! That's him! Remember my warning and go! That Indian sure spoke good English considering he's supposed to be - Maybe he went to night school. - Okay, everybody. We'll head for the dome-shaped building. - Hey, where's Scooby? - He'll catch up to us. Let's move on. Wait for me! - Hey! Come on! Get away from me! - Get out of here! Leave me alone! Go away! If I ever get out of this, we'll call this dance the Batusi. My glasses! - Get out of here, bats! - My glasses! I can't see without them! - I'm getting out of here. - But I've just got to find my glasses! - Hi, Shaggy. - Hi, Scooby. Boy, I sure am glad to get away from those bats. - It's Geronimo! - Geronimo! - Shaggy? - Yipes! It's you, Scooby. Hey, what are you doing with Velma's glasses? Come on. The coast is clear. Where is everybody? Why, Shaggy, you're petrified with fear. And you too, Scooby. Help me find my glasses. Here they are, Velma. - Where did you find them? - It's a long story, Velma. Long story. This looks like their ceremonial building where they held their special rites. - Perfect place for a witch doctor to live. - Yeah. Come on. Let's find him. Hey, look! I doubt if that fire's been burning 1000 years. Freddy, this place gives me goose bumps. You have violated the sacred temple. If you do not leave this village now you will remain here forever. - Okay, we found him. Now let's go. - Not yet. - I want to check that altar. - You check it. - I'll wait right here. - Okay, I'll just be a moment. Daphne? She's gone! Daphne! Daphne! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food? Good boy. Where is it? Lead me to it. What's it smell like, Indian corn? Beef jerky? I'll try anything. Man! Those Pueblo Indians sure knew how to live. We have salami, ham, canned sardines, pudding, not to men- Hey, wait a minute. - This isn't Indian food. - Dog food. - Scooby food. - Scooby food? - Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! - It is dog food. Scooby, we found the dognappers' hideout. But I don't see any dognappers around. So why not fortify ourselves with a groovy little snack? And the ham slice connected to the rye bread. Lettuce connected to the boiled egg. Mustard slapped on a salami slice. And the cheese connected to the deviled ham. Hey, what's this? Scooby-Doo, where are you? Scooby, untie me, quick! That witch doctor may come back at any time. - And the dogs? - The dogs? Oh, sure. We'll free the dogs. Now, hurry! I got a hunch there's a secret passage around here someplace. There it is! - Velma! What are you doing there? - I don't know. I sat down to rest, the next minute I'm here. Freddy! Velma! Quick! This way! Good boy, Scooby! You found them and freed them all! Does this mean we've solved the dognapping mystery? Not yet. Hey, Scooby, see if any of your pals know anything about that witch doctor or the dognapper. Okay. - You know where he is, Scooby? - Yeah! Yeah! Okay, let's go. We're right behind you. While I'm searching for Scooby, I'll just finish this little morsel. Yipe! What a close shave! That was almost a catastrophe. Hey, Shaggy! Come on! Follow the dogs! Come on, Shaggy! Scooby-Doo! They've spotted him! The dogs have him! Why, it's Buck Masters, the owner of Big Red. - He's the dognapper! - You blasted kids! Why didn't you mind your own business? Catching dognappers is our business, Mr. Masters. After all, Scooby-Doo is a dog. And we love him very much. That was quite a plot you kids uncovered. Who would have suspected Masters of dognapping his own pet? He decided to win the dog show by dognapping the only three dogs who could beat Big Red. Then Big Red was to turn up just before the show and win first prize. You said something about a phantom Indian on horseback. - What about that? - Simple. He used a movie projector from the back of his truck. Look! Geronimo! He's back again! Scooby-Doo!
Come. Come. Come. Come. Well, we're almost to the Wetherby estate, gang. It sure is nice of Sharon to ask us up here for the weekend. There's so many groovy things to do. Yeah, like swimming and eating, and tennis and eating, and riding and eating and eating and- How do you like that? Hey, look up there. Jeepers, someone's going into that old mansion. Like, wow. Who'd do a kooky thing like that? I don't know. Gee, it's sure good to see all of you. But I hope this wasn't the wrong weekend for you to come. - Why's that, Sharon? - Well, the last few nights we've been hearing a lot of strange noises. And now it looks like my Uncle Stuart has vanished. Could it have been him we saw going into that old mansion? You mean the Kingston mansion? Maybe we'd better go up there and see. Uncle Stuart? Uncle Stuart? Like, you know, there's no sign of him anywhere. Look, someone's in the shadows. Uncle Stuart. He's become an old man. What happened, Stuart? It started when a ghostly voice called out from the old mansion. I had to obey it. It drew me out of the house. I was in a trance. I went past the Kingston mausoleum and finally into the old mansion. And there is where I saw the ghost of Elias Kingston. The Wetherby fortune belongs to me. Unless it is returned to this mansion before morning the entire family shall suffer this terrible fate. That's when he made me an old man, as a warning to you all. What are we going to do? First of all, I'm going to call the sheriff. That's strange. The phone's dead. Why don't you go get the sheriff, Mr. Wetherby. We'll wait here. We'll keep an eye on Stuart until you get back. - You sure you'll be all right? - Sure. And just to make sure nothing else happens we'll all take turns standing guard. Who's gonna stand the first watch? Who else? The watchdog. Right. The watchdog. - That's me? - That's right. That's you. Just think, Scooby, no ghostly voice will get past your keen sense of hearing. That old hard-of-hearing trick isn't gonna work tonight, Scooby. Come. Come. Where'd he go? Hey, what's with the bugle call, Scooby? It looks like Uncle Stuart's gone again. He's not the only one. Sharon's gone too. - But, like, where? - We'd better get up to that old mansion. And fast. I don't see any sign of Sharon, Uncle Stuart or the ghost. Like, maybe we're in luck and he's out haunting another house. Say, what have you got on your feet, roller skates? - Why are you wearing those things? - I'm not taking any chances. If we do see that ghost, he'll never catch me. Come on, let's keep looking. I wonder if ghosts can hide in little pots. I guess not. Scooby-Doo! Oh, boy, oh, boy. How soggy can a guy get? If there's one thing I can't stand, it's taking a bath in a haunted house. Whether you know it or not, Scooby, you found our first clue. I did? Sure. Who ever heard of a ghost needing a watchdog to scare anybody away? Like, you mean there isn't any ghosts? Well, I haven't seen any. Yet. And we haven't seen Sharon or her uncle either. Hey, was Uncle Stuart wearing a blue suit, red tie and tennis shoes? Yeah, when we last saw him. Then I think we found him. Only he looks a little older now. I guess that ghost wasn't kidding. That's just about as old as you can get. It sure would help if we could find another clue. I found one. - Groovy. What is it? - Him. It's the ghost! Ghost? This is the last warning. Either the fortune is here by morning or all those in the Wetherby house shall grow old. Now go. Old Horrible really said a frightful mouthful. - But we're not gonna let that scare us. - We're not? No, Shaggy. We're gonna solve this mystery. Hey, where's Scooby? I bet he's in that closet. "Out to lunch. " Can you imagine? Yeah, with Scooby, I wouldn't be surprised. How do you like that? He didn't even invite me. Hey, that was the ghost. Yeah, he went into the mausoleum. Come on, let's see what he's up to. Okay, Shaggy. Use Velma's fingerprinting kit and dust for prints. Right, Freddy. I'll give it the old Sherlock Holmes touch. Like, wow. Look at all them fingerprints. Not my hand, silly. That door. Freddy, we got something. Just as I thought. Fingerprints. Wait a minute. Ghosts wouldn't leave fingerprints. - Like, maybe he can turn into a bat. - Don't be silly. Okay, Scooby, go in there and sniff around for that ghost. Would you do it for a Scooby Snack? I'll give you one. How about two? Three. Four? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll go. Scooby-Dooby-Doo! Like, there's times I'll do anything for a Scooby Snack. It's okay. Come on in. - There's no ghost in here. - Well, we know he came in. There's something on that table. This might be a clue. A book on crystalomacy. Crystal O'Macy? I used to know a Crystal Nerdlinger. It's not a girl, silly. It's a book about how to use a crystal ball. - You mean the kind a fortuneteller uses? - Right. Say, there's an old swami place in town. Maybe there's some kind of a connection. Zoinks, the door! Hey, we're locked in. Well, let's hope there's a secret way out of here. Start tapping on the walls. Hey. Like, what happened to Scooby? He was right there a second ago. It's a secret passage. You did it, Scooby. You found the way out. I did? Well, Scooby-Dooby-Doo! That secret passage was a shortcut to the Wetherby estate. I wonder if it has to do with Sharon's disappearance. I don't know. But maybe we'll find the answer here at the swami's place. It looks like the swami's out swami-ing somewhere else. I guess he won't mind if we take a look around. I wonder what's in here. Daphne, not the storage closet. Well, Daphne, you did it again. Like, someone's coming. Yoo-hoo. Swami. Oh, Swami. Oh, there you are. - Oh, no. A customer. - And she thinks Scooby's the swami. Shaggy, you better throw your voice and make Scooby sound like a swami. - Yeah, I better. - Mr. Swami, I have something to ask you. Good evening. Please be seated. Oh, swami, tell me, what do you see in the crystal ball? - My reflection. - Your reflection? My word. No, wait. I see a tall, handsome man in your future. And you're dancing together cheek to cheek. Now he's whispering something to you. - He is? What is the dear boy saying? - "Get off my foot. " Enough of this. I want my palm read. Yes, ma'am. You did say "red. " How dare you! How about that? All that advice and she didn't even pay us a dime. I hope that's the end of the customers for a while. Okay, gang. Let's get on with our investigation. Hey, look. The table's floating. Zoinks! It's the gooney ghost! You did not do as I said. Now you shall pay. Hey, look out! Duck! It's after us! Here it comes again. I've heard of flying saucers, but this is silly. Run. Run. Run. We got rid of it. We did? Then, like, what's that? - He's a real joker. - I'm not laughing. Duck! Look out, Scooby! Scooby caught the table. Man, this flew like it was jet-propelled. You mean like fan-propelled. See? A fan-type motor underneath gave it the power. Are you okay, Scooby? I'm okay. Hey, look, suitcases. Maybe somebody just moved in. Then let's move out. And look what I found: A professional makeup kit. And what's that? It looks like a TV camera. You're right, Shaggy. Yeah. It's a miniature TV camera. Hey, smile, Scooby. That's how the ghost got on the crystal ball: Closed-circuit TV. See, Scooby? That's how you look on TV. What a ham. Well, we got a lot of clues. - We do? - She's right. Enough clues to turn the tables on that ghost. Now, here's what we're gonna do. Yoo-hoo, Mr. Ghost! I'm here with the fortune. Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo! Good. You brought the fortune. How fortunate for you. Stay until I see with my own eyes. It's a trick. I'll turn you to bones! The plan's working, Scooby. - You can't get away! - Quick, get behind the curtain. Scooby, I hope the ghost doesn't find us. Perfecto. I got my shoes, now let's join the gang. I can hear the ghost coming. Get ready for phase two. - All set, Shaggy? - Yeah. Let's go. - He's in the hall. - Turn on the projector. Stop, or I'll mummify you! Wait. Hold it. This place is really haunted. Now watch what he does when he sees the tape of you, Scooby. Oh, no! That does it. It's working, Sharon. He's going into the secret room, where he had me tied up. Well, Miss Sharon, I still have you, and the fortune shall yet be mine- How did that get here? Let me out of here. Here he comes. Golly, he's running like a ghost was after him. - Now. Throw it! - Bombs away! I guess that about wraps up the ghost story. Scooby-Dooby-Doo! Mr. Wetherby, this ghost really doesn't need any introduction. As soon as we clean him up I'm sure you'll recognize him. There. Look familiar? - Uncle Stuart. - Like, in person. He thought he could scare you into giving up the family fortune. That ghostly wailing was only a recording. And by a clever use of makeup, he made himself look old. When I came downstairs to investigate a noise, I saw Uncle Stuart's wig blow off. - I knew he wasn't old. - So he had to take you prisoner. But where does the swami come in? What better way for a swindler to disappear? Uncle Stuart, why did you do it? Well, I guess he can explain it to the sheriff when he gets here. - I bet you kids are starving. - Groovy. Zoinks, that's for me. Hey, what's this? "Scooby-Doo was here. " The whole turkey? Gone? Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
Gee, this is wonderful, Uncle John. The Ape Man Of Forbidden Mountain. What a groovy title for a picture. It sure was swell of you to give us jobs as extras. Kids, I'm the grateful one. I need you because the local people won't work in this film. - Why is that, Mr. Maxwell? - The local people are very superstitious. They believe an old legend about a real Ape Man. They say he's the one that burned down the old mansion years ago. - How do I look? - How do you look? I don't see any difference. We've had three reports that the Ape Man has been seen up here at night. They've seen a real Ape Man? Real Ape Man? I just remembered a dental appointment back in town. - Me too. - Stop it, you two. It's only a superstition. Right, Uncle John? Right. The only Ape Man on this mountain is my stuntman Carl. Any time you're ready, J.J. All right, Miss Mint, you just run out on the rope bridge. Okay? Right, Mr. Maxwell. That's our star, Candy Mint. And you'll see Carl in the Ape Man suit. Okay, roll them! Man, he could be for real. What a beast. Yeah, beast. Great. He's even better than he was in rehearsal. Now, watch Candy on the bridge. Watch the Ape Man jump up and down on the bridge and try to spill Candy. No, Carl! Stop it! That's not in the script! Help! I don't think he heard you. He heard me, but that ape is not my stuntman. Somebody, make him stop! Scooby-Doo! Help! Help! Scooby, steady the bridge! - She made it! - And Scooby did it! - Good show, Scooby. - You sure sent that thing packing. You were so brave. Scooby-Dooby-Doo. - That was a daring rescue, Scooby. - He was better than Laddie. - What do we do now, Mr. Maxwell? - Find my missing stuntman, Carl. - This is his trailer. - Maybe we can pick up a clue to where Carl might be. I'm worried. I didn't put much stock in that Ape Man legend until now. Hey, Scooby, is that you acting scared? Ape Man's head. Ape Man's head? Oh, that's just part of a costume. Hey, that's a good trick. - How'd you do it? - I don't know. Then there must be somebody in the trunk. - Come on, Scooby, open it. - Not me. - Yes, you. - Now, Scooby don't go into one of your acts. Just open the trunk. Okay. - It's a man! - It's a man? It must be Carl, the stuntman. - What happened? - I came in to dress and a big, hairy animal grabbed me and threw me in the trunk. - Was it the Ape Man? - Ape Man? What's going on? An Ape Man of some kind sabotaged our shooting and almost hurt Candy. The old legend, huh? It must have been him that got me. Oh, Mr. Maxwell, I'm sorry, but I quit until that beast is caught. I'm with her. Mr. Maxwell, I'm quitting too. Can't you wait a few days? I'll get this mystery cleared up. I'm afraid I'll have to withdraw my job offer. It's just too dangerous right now. - Yeah! - Maybe we can give you a hand in solving this mystery. - Well - We can stand guard. Yeah, who's afraid of a big, bad ape? I am. Okay, gang, Daphne's uncle let us stay on the condition we be careful. According to the legend the Ape Man lives in a secret cave somewhere in the rocks. It's strange how he was smart enough -  to get rid of that stuntman. - There's something fishy about that. A dumb Ape Man is bad enough. One that smart I can live without. - Get it? Live without. - Me too. Did you know that this set is built on the ruins of the original old mansion? There should be some good clue-hunting around here. Well, what are we waiting for? Let's search. Scooby-Doo! Keep a sharp lookout for anything that will give us a clue. Hey, Scooby, what's that you found? Somebody left half a hamburger. - Hunting clues always makes me hungry. - Wait! - That's a clue. - Don't eat that clue, Shaggy. - Clue? - Yeah, clue. See those claw marks? The Ape Man was eating this sandwich. - That's odd. Apes don't eat meat. - Maybe this Ape Man is more than an ape. - It's okay, Shaggy. You can eat it. - What? Me eat after an ape? I can't do it. I'll do it. Okay, let's split up and search for this Ape Man who eats hamburgers. And remember, this set was built to make a scary movie. So watch out for trap doors. Trap doors? Hidden bedrooms? - It's kind of spooky in here. - Oh, don't be a scaredy-cat. Stick them up. What's the password? - Shaggy, are you trying to be funny? - No, but somebody else is trying. Stick them up. What's the password? Stick them up. What's the password? The great ape is first-rate. Wait a minute. That sounds like a parrot. Stick them up. What's the password? Scooby-Doo! That's what I call fowl play. Get it? It's the Ape Man! Look out! Help! He got me! Can't we talk this over man to Ape Man? Shaggy, that ape is stuffed. Stuffed ape? Well, I hope you don't think it had me fooled for a minute. I knew it all the time. Oh, brother. There isn't anything in here but old books. Here's something. A copy of the film's shooting script. Next you'll say the Ape Man was here reading it. It was left open to the scene they were shooting today. Maybe there's a clue up here on these shelves. Hey, did you know that in the film, people mysteriously vanished from this room? Hey, where did Freddy go? He's vanished! - What's with Scooby-Doo? - Something about the mirror. Watch. - Something phony. - Something phony? See? Zoinks! Cut out! It's the Ape Man! It's locked. - Scooby, do something. - Yeah. Talk to him, dog to beast. - Whatever you said, Scooby, it's working. - He's retreating. After him. It's dark at the top of the stairs. He'll get away. Turn on some lights, Daphne. Oh, dear. Which is the right switch? Wrong switch, Daphne. Scooby-Doo! Why didn't you put on the brakes, Scooby? I like to slide. He likes to slide. Oh, boy. That puts the stairs back, but I wonder what the other switches do. Well, with your luck, Daph the next button you push will bring the roof down, but go ahead. I'll try this one. - Hi, gang. - It's Freddy! - Boy, the Ape Man almost got us. - But Scooby scared him away. Well, I found the perfect trap for the Ape Man. Come on. Now, this is the basement where the last scenes of the movie are to be shot. Look up there on the ceiling. That net was put up to capture the Ape Man in the film. And we can use it to capture the real Ape Man. - Yeah, yeah, yeah! - Great. How do you know it will work? I've tested it. See that pulley? The net's connected to the rope, the rope runs down to the reel and the reel is wired to that dark switch box, which you'll pull to release the net. And look, under the net there's an X on the floor where the Ape Man should be when the net falls. But how are we gonna get him to stand there? Simple, Daphne. When the Ape Man reaches the X we will put the spotlight on him and blind him for a second while Velma pulls the switch. Yeah, but how are you gonna get the Ape Man down in the basement? - Hey, don't look at me. - Don't look at me. Scooby, will you do it for a few Scooby Snacks? You get a bonus snack after you get the Ape Man down here. - Okay? - Okay. Scooby Snacks won't work on me this time. Would you do it for a Shaggy Snack? A little something I whipped up. - A Shaggy Snack? - Yes. It's a potpie with pizza crust anchovies, pepperoni, cherries and all in a thick chocolate sauce. - I'll do it. I'll do it. - Let's go. Scooby-Doo! - What's that noise? - I don't know. It came from this room. Wow, look at those trophies. A deer, a rhino, a lion and a Ape Man? Ape Man? Don't be silly. That's only a trophy. Come on, let's play a game, Scooby. Some trophies. One, two, three, four. - Hey, Shaggy. - Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Watch this shot. One, two, three Eight ball in the corner pocket. Sorry, Scooby. One, two, three Let's see, Scooby's over there. Then who is-? Let's go! Here they come. Ready, Velma? All set, Freddy. No, Scooby, not here. Hey, you're steaming up my glasses. Get ready to spring the trap! Now, Velma! I can't see. I hope this is it. Pull the other switch, Velma! Quick, spring the trap! I'm trying. That's it. Now get the lights back on. Hey, we got him. Come on, gang. Yeah, you got him. King Kong in the flesh. King Kong. It's a cinch that Ape Man is still in the basement. - He didn't have time to go back upstairs. - Hey, gang. Looks like Scooby found a clue. - What is it? - Scooby's pointing to a tuft of hair -  caught in this cask. - Let's have a look. So the Ape Man ran by here. What does it prove? - Maybe it's not a wine cask. - Okay, if it's not, what do you think it is? Offhand, I'd call it a door. It's a tunnel that goes back into the mountain. So this is the way he escaped. He won't get away this time. The film company didn't build this tunnel. No, this is more like the cave where the Ape Man is supposed to live. - If you believe the old legend. - I believe it. Where are we? Wow, the dressing rooms for the movie people. And we'd better search them. Come on. We'll split up here. Shaggy, you and Scooby take this one. Now, play it cool. Cool? I'm an ice cube. We'll go on and take the next one. Look at all this groovy stuff. Man, we could play Halloween. Check this, Scooby. Give me liberty, or give me pizza pie. Hey, Shag. That's great, Scooby. Hey, here's one of those jiffy cameras. It develops a shot in less than a minute. I'll take your picture. - Act fierce. - Okay. Great. Do another. How's this? I've gotta wind in another frame. That's the Ape Man in the mirror without his mask on. Look out, Scooby! The Ape Man! Gangway! I got it! Hey, gang, I got the Ape Man on film. That's Shaggy and Scooby! I got a picture of the Ape Man without his mask. He's right behind us. Quick! Run for the house so we can trap him. Keep going right up the stairs and don't stop. Help! Hey, look at this snapshot. Here's a clue to end all clues. Take a look at our Ape Man. It's Carl, the stuntman! Yep, Carl decided to sabotage the picture just because I wouldn't let him play the lead. What a pity. It sure was clever of him to lock himself in that trunk yesterday. And tell that phony story about the Ape Man throwing him in. Well, I can't thank you kids enough. Shaggy should get most of the credit. Where is Shaggy? Oh, no, not again. Looks like Shaggy wants to try for the Ape Man role in the picture. Surprise. But there's Scooby-Doo in the other chair. Surprise. It's the Scooby head the Ape Man was wearing. Now, there's real talent. We sure fooled them, Scooby. We ought to be in the movies. Yeah. Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
Time to go, gang. It's getting dark. - Hey, let's have that last clam, Scooby. - Coming up. Scooby-Doo! Good shot! I've heard of bird dogs and rabbit dogs but you're the first clam dog I ever heard of. Clam dog? Shaggy, you know Scooby doesn't like clams. I like them. They're fun to dig and even more fun to eat. Don't you wish Funland was open? The root-beer floats, the chocolate custard, the rides. Man, that's living. Yes, but right now it looks a little spooky -  even haunted. - Haunted? Don't be silly, Daphne. Hey, look at that! But that's impossible. That place won't be open for weeks. Look! Well, this calls for a little investigation. It's hard to believe. Everything's running, but nobody's here. Man, it's a dream come true. Let's check out that lunch counter over there, Scooby. A little service, please? For openers, I'd like a malt and a hot dog with all the trimmings. Me too. Who did that? Hey, I used to be pretty good at this. - Should I give it a whirl? - Go ahead. - Who's to know? - Okay. Batter up! Good throw, Freddy! Well, I've still got the old touch. Let's go find Shaggy and Scooby. Gee, Freddy, shouldn't we stack those bottles back up? You're right, Daphne. Look! The bottles are all stacked up again! And what's that on the counter? It's a prize for knocking down the bottles. Our backs were only turned for a minute. Oh, wow! Freddy, this is really weird. Well, somehow I got this prize, so the least I can do is pay my 2 bits. What a cute kewpie doll. Oh, no! The cash register rang up 25 cents. I'm beginning to wonder if this place is haunted. Scooby, do you think we stand a chance of getting some cotton candy too? - Yeah! - Hold it. I just saw somebody. There he goes again! Man, he's faster than a speeding bullet. Superman! Come on, Scooby. Pick up the scent. - No scent. - No scent? He has to have a scent. Why, he'd have to be a ghost not to leave a scent. Did I say "ghost"? - What's the matter with you? - I'm pointing. You're pointing? Oh! I see him. That was no ghost. He looks more like a man from Mars. Wow! Look what that last hot dog did to me! Look at me! I knew I was sharp but this pointed head is too much. A giant mouse! That's no giant mouse. It's only a little mouse. Scooby-Doo, where are you? There he is! What do you say? Let's go find the others. Scooby-Doo! I'm with you! I don't see Scooby or Shaggy anywhere. There's someone going along behind that fence. It's no one we know. But whoever it is, I'd like to ask him a few questions. He's taking a ride on the Ferris wheel. It stopped. That man is trapped up on top. I'll get him down. I want to talk to him. I'll have to crank the wheel down by hand. We can't leave him up there. You've turned it all the way around, but he's gone. He couldn't have climbed down without us seeing. Look! The lights are going off all over the park! Well, this is the first time I ever wanted to leave Funland. Scooby and I saw him. Strictly a weirdo from outer space. - We saw him too. - Look. I wonder whose house that is. It could be the caretaker. Let's go see. We should tell him about these mysterious happenings. I hope he's a nice, sweet old caretaker. And believe me, Mr. Jenkins, all the rides were running. - I don't see how. - Well, she was sure running wide-open. - Lights, music, everything. - That's impossible. We're the caretakers here. My brother and I would've seen the lights. - Sarah's right. - Well, we saw a very strange character -  running around out there. - He was, like, weirdo. - Weirdo-like. - Fiddlesticks! Besides us, there's no one else on this island. - Maybe the moonlight was playing tricks. - But, man, I tell you- Let it go. Sorry to have bothered you, sir. Let's go, gang. Well, how did you like that for double talk? We can't go home now. We know we didn't imagine -  all those kooky things that happened. - Count me out. I'm not looking for any creep with a frozen face. Shaggy, sometimes I think you'd rather eat pizza pie than solve a mystery. - Let's vote on it. Mystery or pizza pie? - Pizza pie. Cut it out, you two. Come on, let's get back to the beach. - Okay. We'll keep a watch from here. - It's sure dark. What do they call this, a stakeout? I'd rather have a steak-in. Like, a sirloin steak in me, that is. Me too. Yeah! - Oh, stop it! Stop it! I can't stand it! - Be quiet, you two. We've been here an hour, and no sign of life. We'll give it 10 minutes more. Is that music I hear? - Look! All the lights are going on! - Here we go again! No doubt this time. Let's get over there, quick! - Something's haywire. - What's wrong with the merry-go-round? It's running backwards. Look at that cotton-candy machine. It's running wild! And the hot-dog stand. I can't stand it! What's the matter, Scooby? I like to eat too, you know. Look! There's that strange guy again. - What a time for a sideshow. - Come on, everybody. After him! Look what he's doing. What's wrong with him? Help! Shaggy, he's got me! Let go! Let go! He got me! He got me! Help! No, he didn't. There he goes now into the Tunnel of Love. So we have to go into the tunnel after him. I want to go, like, home. Row faster! We can catch him! - There's something in that tunnel! - It's him! - He's swimming right at us! - I thought we wanted to catch him. Like a torpedo, he's going to ram us! Don't panic! I'll save you! Thanks, Shaggy, but why don't we just walk out. Oh, yeah. Good idea. That's no ordinary man. He's going to be hard to track down. He'd better look out I don't catch him. I'll make him pay for what he did to my hair. - Let's go back. - We can't go back, Scooby. Freddy said to look on this side of the park. It's okay just to look for the torpedo man, as long as we don't find him. What's that? Oh, that. That's a real fun game, Scooby. Come on. I'll show you how it works. Now, you take this hammer, and you hit that button. The ball goes up to the top and rings the bell. Now watch the old master. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Now I got it! - Hey, what you doing? - My turn. Your turn? With your tail? Let me out of the way. Scooby-Doo! Hey, that was great! You gotta have the strongest tail in the world. It's him. He wins! Let's go, man! He's gaining on us! Head for the roller coaster! He's climbing up the cars after us! Let's go, Scooby! Here we go! We're trapped! Look! There's Shaggy and Scooby in the front seat of that car! And that strange man is after them! There's an empty car going up the other track. I'll slow it down, and maybe they'll jump into it. Jump, Shaggy! - They made it! - Scooby-Doo! Nice jump, you guys. Thanks, gang. But don't ever let us do that again. I think that character's train is coming in. Everybody hide behind those crates. But it's empty. How could he get out? Look! He's up there! What's he going to do? He's diving off! - Come on! He could be hurt! - Let's go, Scooby! He's not here! - He crashed through the tent there. - You can see where he hit the crate. - It defies all the known laws of physics. - I wish you could have seen his eyes. - Like two taillights on a hot rod. - Yeah! Hot rod! Hot rod! That's it! The answer is, that this guy can move so fast we need something fast to catch him. We're gonna soup up this electric car to catch him? Right. We'll increase the flow of power from the battery. This might jazz it up. No, Shaggy! You turned it on at the motor! Now Velma can't stop it! My glasses! I lost them! There's no brakes, Scooby, and I can't see without my glasses. But it's a nice, wide street. Oh, don't fret, Scooby. - Hey, that's him! - Oh, I see the traffic cop, silly. Right turn, isn't it? Go, Velma! Hey, Scooby, are we in the right lane now? Right lane? Train coming! Train coming? I told you I can't stop. The train will just have to look out for itself. Here they come! Look out for the cotton candy, Velma! - I think we've stalled. - Wow, at least you're safe. What luck. What do you mean, luck? We didn't have a bit of trouble. Ask Scooby. Scooby-Doo! - Well, that does it. - But this guy is sure strong and fast. So we've had to build the prize trap of all time to catch him. And this crate is it. Now here's the plan. Someone will lure the stranger into this trap. But our man will be trapped in the crate with that weirdo. No. Look up there. We'll pull our man out of the trap in the basket. Shaggy'll lock the door, and Velma and I will pull up the basket. And all Scooby has to do is lure the stranger into the trap. - Anybody got a Scooby Snack? - No snacks. Not me. It's not fair. I'll go with Scooby. - We can use the dodgem car. - No car! I'll go! I'll go! Set the trap! Set the trap! Set the trap! Get ready, everyone! Here they come! We got him! - Scooby's safe! - We got him trapped! We got him! What was that? Like, you won't believe it. He went through the back of the trap then through a wooden crate and out the back through a brick wall! What a man! He's not human! You are absolutely right. He's not human. He's a robot. - It's Mr. Jenkins, the caretaker! - What did you say, sir? He's Charlie, the world's most perfect robot. I programmed him to operate everything in Funland. - But why? - I wanted to make enough robots -  to run the whole park. - What happened? Your robot's been tearing up the place. Somehow he got out of control. But we can stop him if you kids will help me. Here we go again. How does this equipment work? It's quite simple. Once we find Charlie the powerful electric magnet will pull his metal body to it. Slow down. Charlie's close by. Look at that needle. Turn on the big magnet. It's on. Aim it over at that shack. I saw something move. Don't fight it, Charlie. What happened? This cable has been cut. - Charlie's crashed! - I was afraid of that. The electromagnet has fouled up his circuits. Hey, Scooby's up to something. Somebody's behind that fence. Come out of there! Sarah! What are you doing here? It was me that caused Charlie to go out of control. I don't think robots should work where children come to have fun. She's right. Charlie is nice, but kids need humans. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! - I never thought about that. I just wanted a perfect robot. But never mind. I'll rebuild him and call him "Charlie the Second. " Well, kids, Charlie's repaired, and I think he's better than ever. That great, Mr. Jenkins. We came back today to see if you had him fixed up. - Hey, where's Scooby? - Well, would you look at that? He's getting his ears scratched. Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy! Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
Say, Scooby, kind of a spooky night, huh? Yeah, spooky. The aroma of this pizza is, like, driving me wild. You wanna eat it now? Like, right this minute? - Yeah, yeah! - Man, this is gonna be delicious. After all, we only had two blockbuster pizzas at the Pizza Palace. That's hardly even a snack. I always wanted to be a pizza chef. Watch this. Well, thanks for leaving my finger. Maybe that's the gang in the Mystery Machine. Hey, mister! You lost something! I guess he didn't hear me. Let's go see what it is. It's a violin case. It feels kind of heavy. Yeah, I know, and you never had a lesson in your life. Holy moly! What's this? It's full of money! - There must be thousands of dollars. - Millions. - Here, hold this. - Me? Yes, you. Guard that while I go phone the gang. Trouble. What's wrong? It's gone! I goofed. What happened, Scooby? Where's the violin case full of money? - I got you. You put the case on the curb. - Yeah. Then what? - Girl dog. - A girl dog with big eyelashes. She was in trouble. You put the violin case down and went over to see her. And while you were gone, someone took the case. - Show us where the girl dog was. - Okay. Here. Let's look around. There might be a clue. It'd be better if we knew what we were looking for. What's this? It's a puppet control. I wonder what it's doing here. Let me see it. Something is written on this control. "Pietro's Puppets. " That must be the puppet show at the Strand. - You think the other dog was a puppet? - Yeah, yeah. So it was the girl-dog puppet that lured you away from the violin case. - Right! Right! - We have ourselves a little mystery. Let's examine the clues: A puppet dog, a violin case packs of brand-new bills. Very strange. They don't seem to hold together. Unless - You've got it. - That's it. Counterfeiters! The thing to do is get in the Strand Theater and look around. But how? How about getting an audition for a trained dog act? - "Trained dog"? - That's a great idea. Trained dog? Don't look now, fans, but I think a star is about to be born. - There's someone inside. - Likely a watchman or a doorman. Look, he's working a puppet. Could be another clue for us, all right. Let's go inside. - Hello. - Well, hello. What can I do for you? We're inquiring about arranging an audition for our trained dog. He's a great talent. Do a bit, Scooby. Well, that was pretty good. What do you say, Johnny? No. Sorry, chum, but you can't work this show unless you're a puppet. - You're very good. You a puppet master? - No, I just fiddle with them as a hobby. You're okay with me, Pop. Well, you certainly seem professional. Well, why not? The great Pietro has helped me. How long have-? - What's with him? - Yeah, what's with you, Scooby-Doo? A witch! A witch! A witch? I get it. One of the puppets scared you. Okay, let me up. - You'll have to excuse him. - That's okay. I'll go put Johnny away. Shaggy, look. Look what I got. A brand-new bill, just like in the violin case. Quick, hide it. - Now, about that audition- - Not right now. We've really got to go. - What? - What's the rush? Freddy's right. We really gotta go. Well, we sure enjoyed the puppets. Goodbye. Anytime. Anytime. Goodbye. Well, why the rush? We didn't get a chance to look for clues. - Show them the clue, Shaggy. - It was in the doorman's desk drawer. - A brand-new $20 bill. - And I'll bet you a doughnut it's a phony. - It sure looks real. - Let's change it into a blockbuster pizza. Yeah! Be serious. My expert opinion on the authenticity of this bill is: - It's absolutely genuine. - That 20 was planted to throw us off? - How come? - Yeah, like, why? To make us think nothing fishy was going on there. So we wouldn't think of going back. - I get it. But now what do we do? - We go back. Oh, no. We're in luck. The doorman's asleep. Come on, the door's unlocked. Let's give this stage a good going-over. - What are we looking for? - Clues, of course. Any kind of clues. Why not start here in the clues closet? Nope. Nothing here. Shaggy, that's the worst joke I ever heard. Be serious, you guys. Let's split up and start searching. Everybody know the signal? - Do you know the signal, Scooby? - Sure. - Quiet. - Sorry. Yeah, like, watch it. You stay close to Scooby. We don't want any more noise. Okay? Let's go. Wow. There's a lot of searching to do around these old sets. - We better split up and look around. - Right. Don't forget, if you see anything suspicious bark three times. - Scoob, watch what you bump into. - I didn't do it. A guy could get hurt around here. Come on, let's look somewhere else. Gee, Velma, I wish we had a clue to a clue. Don't worry, Daphne. If we stick around here, we're bound to find something. Wow, we almost got hit by that sandbag! Yeah, I guess the rope must have broke. Broke, nothing. Look. It's been cut with a knife. And ropes don't cut themselves. - Let's look in the dressing room area. - Okay, Shaggy. There should be a lot of junk in here to check over. - Let's browse around here a bit. - Right. - What's with you, Scooby-Doo? - He's after me! - He's after you? - Yeah, yeah! It's only a jack-in-the-box. - Stop clowning around and keep looking. - Right. Funny faces. Hey, Scooby, check this. Pretty heroic, huh? Yeah, yeah. Watch this. That's great. Hold it a sec. The cloaked cavalier. That's a doozy. - There were two of you! - There were two of me? I don't get it. Give me. - Two of you. - You saw somebody dressed like me? - Yeah, yeah. - Let's get out of here! I wish I knew what we were looking for. - We'll know when we find it. - Yeah, if we find it. Daphne. Velma. Come over here. I saw him! He was in that prompter's box! Run! Get out of here! - There's a guy in a black cape around. - He was in that prompter's box. We ought to see what's in there. Right, Scooby? Not me. Here's a Scooby Snack. No strings attached. Just catch. Dirty trick. What's down there, Scooby? - Violin cases. - Violin cases? Well, come on. Let's get down below stage. Quick. - What now? They're all empty. - Not even violins in them. Maybe this thing is a wild-goose chase. How about that man in the black cape? Explain him. And Scooby, he saw that man in the black too, didn't you? Somebody's playing the big organ on the stage. - He's gone! - It must have been our imagination. Well, that was the first time I ever heard mine. - What was that? - I don't like looking for clues anymore. That's the one. Look, Scooby has a dog puppet. So this is the canine Mata Hari. What's sticking out of that puppet's stuffing? What a clue! It's the front engraving plate for a $20 bill. Time to wake that doorman up and tell him what's going on. Good idea. Let's go. Mr. Doorman, wake up! Wake up! Come on, wake up! It- It- - He's a puppet too! - That's all for me, fans. We're locked in! But good. But we've got to get out with this important clue. - There goes the plate, our only clue! - What will we do now? We're going back to that violin case room and give it another going-over. - Okay, how do we start? - Look for something out of the ordinary. Take a good look around. - That harp case could hide something. - I wonder if it's empty too. It's sure not empty. It's got a whole room in it! Wow! We hit the jackpot. Look at that printing press! And all those new $20 bills on the table. You were right, Freddy, it's a big counterfeit operation. It's him! - Yipes! - Double yipes! Let's get out of here! There's a door up ahead! You know my secret! - Golly! Where's that voice coming from? - In this tunnel. Who knows? It's a dead end! This ladder's our only way. But I can't see where it goes. We got no choice. Start climbing. - Where are we? - I'm not sure. You have learned my secret. Now you can never go! Come on, think of something. Look, one man isn't too heavy. If we all push together -  maybe we can throw him off. - Okay, let's go. Where did he go? - Where are we? - Back on the stage. Careful, everybody. He's around here some place. Wait for me. - Wait a minute. - Me, wait? Why? There's nothing to be afraid of. Remember the doorman? - He was a life-sized puppet, wasn't he? - Yes. - What do you think these are? - You're right: Puppets. Then there must be a puppet master. - There he is! We've got to catch him! - Look at Scooby-Doo! How do you like that? Old Scooby-Doo's got him on the run! Good work, Scooby! I'll give you a hand! You deserve a lot of credit. This town's been flooded with phony 20s for weeks. It was nothing, really. But old Mr. Pietro, posing as the doorman, sure had us fooled for a while. He gave himself away when he put on his puppet show for us. The real hero is Scooby-Doo. By the way, where is he? Oh, no. Look at him. Like I said before, what a ham. Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
