What a nervous night to be walking home from the movies, Scooby-Doo. And all because you had to stay and see Star: Dog Ranger of the North Woods twice. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! - What's that? - It's coming from the bushes. Go see what it is, Scooby. - Don't worry, I'm right behind you. - Thanks a lot. Oh, well. Scooby, come back! Wait! Where he go? Where he go? - Like, next time, signal. - Sorry. Hey, what's that? Looks like a deserted-type pickup truck. Anyone home? You're right, Shaggy. This sure is strange. Yeah. What's an empty, old suit of armor doing in the driver's seat of this pickup? Maybe he went out for the knight. Get it? - Very funny. - Gosh I wonder who this creepy hunk of tin belongs to. Well, the name on the crate says, "Jameson Hyde White Professor of Archeology. London, England. " - Hyde White? - I've heard of hide-and-seek before but I've never heard of Hyde White. That's an English name, you comedians. Hey, what's this? It's a delivery label that says: "Deliver to the County Museum. " So that's where the old knight was headed for. That's using the old noodle. But, like, what happened to our mysterious professor? Well, if he was driving this truck, he's disappeared. Well, gang, it looks like we're up to our armor plates in another mystery. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. I suppose I should thank you for finding the Black Knight. But with Professor Hyde White's mysterious disappearance and all I wish you hadn't. - Why is that, Mr. Wickles? - Because of the legend. - Legend? - Yes. The Black Knight is supposed to come alive when the moon is full. Like, wow! The moon was full last night. Then what was the professor doing with tall, tin, dark and creepy? He was delivering it to the museum. All the way from England. - Where do you want it, Mr. Wickles? - Just put it in the Medieval Room. Right. What's this? Scooby-Doo, where are you? - Come on, Scooby. We're leaving. - Coming. This mystery's got me baffled. Well, it's got me, like, hungry. When do we eat? - Let's eat! - Hey, what's Scooby wearing? They look like some crazy kind of glasses. - He must've found them at the museum. - Yeah, yeah. Man, I wonder what kind of groovy things you see with those. Well, there's one way to find out. Here it is! They're a special type of magnifying glasses used by jewelers, scientists and archeologists. And hold on to your Hula-Hoops. It says here, "made only in England. " - Archeologists? - England? Professor Hyde White! That settles it. There's something fishy going on in that museum. - Museum? - Right, Scooby. Tonight we're going fishing. This place is locked up tighter than a drum. Then, like, how do we get in? Easy. Shaggy goes through that window up there. - Why me? - Because that's a small window -  and you're the thinnest. - Oh, boy. Come on, give me a hand with this ladder. - It won't reach. - I guess we don't get in. Well, if we don't, we'll never find out what happened to the missing professor. Shaggy, you start up, and I'll get the jack out of the Mystery Machine. Right. - Hang on, Shaggy. - Like, right, man. I'll start cranking. And I'll keep hanging on. - That's it, no more jack. - He still can't reach it. Don't worry. Shaggy's the swingingest gymnast in school. When you get in, open the back door. Right. Watch me swing right in. Well, at least we know he's inside. The Black Knight. Sure glad it's empty. Golly, this place sure is creepy at night. It's even creepy during the day. I think we'd better split up. Daphne and I will go this way you two go that way. And, Scooby, stand guard. Would you do it for a Scooby Snack? - Two? - Okay, two it is. Scooby-Doo! Yikes! - I think we're being followed. - Yeah, by Scooby. All right, Scooby-Doo, you can come with us. All right, all right. Down, down. What did you do that for? You know how that full moon turns on that Black Knight. - That's only a superstitious legend. - Well, I'm not taking any chances. I'm with you. Oh, no, we lost Shaggy. I hope we find Shaggy soon. Stop that noise. I've got it! That's better. Come on. What a spooky place. Not now, Scooby. Not now. Now, look what that dog did. He knows I can't see without my glasses. There you are, Shaggy. You sound terrible. I told you to take care of that cold. Lucky I brought your medicine. I can't find that Velma nowheres. Zoinks! This will fix you up in a jiffy. Let's get out of here! See? You sound better already. Scooby-Doo! Scooby-Dooby-Doo! Sorry! Bye-bye! I tell you, the Black Knight is alive and roaming through the hallways. If we could only find a clue. It's Scooby! When Velma said, "clue," she didn't mean you, Scooby. Hey, like, wait a minute. There's a picture missing from the wall. Maybe that's a clue. - We better tell the others. - Right! It's right down here. - There's no picture missing, Shaggy. - Well, it was a minute ago. Some clue. Well, if that's blood that's a clue. It's paint. And look. A trail of it leads down the hallway. Come on, follow that paint. The trail of paint ends here at the mummy case. Come on, Shaggy. Help me open it. Don't like surprises, especially spooky ones. Oh, come on. Hey, look, a secret room. Somebody sure is a messy housekeeper. And look at that. There are two paintings exactly alike. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Right, Velma. This just about solves the mystery. - It does? - What? No time to explain now, Shaggy. We gotta get the sheriff. Let's take this back way out. Leave it to Daphne to pick the wrong door. Zoinks! Scooby, like, do something. Maybe my ventriloquism bit can get us out of this jam. If I can throw my voice to make it sound like it's coming from the room he might leave. Help! Let me out of this pot! - Help! - Help! Scooby-Doo! Zoinks! Scooby! Yikes! Scooby-Doo! We did it, Scooby-Doo. We did it. We did? Scooby-Doo! - Just as we thought! - It's the curator, Mr. Wickles. We've gotta hand it to you kids. We never would have suspected Wickles as the art swindler. Boy, it was a neat setup. He and his gang were switching fake pieces of art for the real ones in the museum. They made the fakes at night, in a secret workshop behind the mummy case. That's why they had to get rid of the professor. He was the only one who could have spotted the fakes. Oh, my gosh! Professor Hyde White! We never found him. - It's Scooby-Doo with a shoe. - Follow me! See? Professor Hyde White! All the time, it was Wickles who made that Black Knight come to life. - Then there was no legend. - Positively not. Wickles just used the story to cover up my mysterious disappearance. Somehow, he managed to get into the armor, down at the train station. And, like, on the way to the museum, he made you disappear. Zoinks! He's alive! Scooby-Doo!
